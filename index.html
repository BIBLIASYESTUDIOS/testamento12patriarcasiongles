        <h2 dir="ltr" >REUBEN'S WILL</h2>
        
        <h3 dir="ltr" >About thoughts</h3>
        
        <p>1- 1Copy of Reuben's will and his recommendations to his sons, before he died at the age of one hundred and twenty-five. 2Two years after Joseph's death, Reuben was sick, and his sons and grandsons gathered to visit him.<br />
        3He said to them:<br />
        "My sons, I am dying, and I am going to follow the way of my fathers."<br />
        4Then he saw Judah, Gad, and Asher, his brothers, and he pleaded with them:<br />
        "Brothers, let me be made known, so that I may reveal to you, my brothers and sons, all that is hidden in my heart, for my strength is failing me."<br />
        5He stood up, kissed them affectionately, and burst into tears. He said to them:<br />
        "Listen, my brothers, listen to Reuben, your father, and to what I command you. 6I adjure you today by the God of heaven: do not be carried away by youthful ignorance or by lust. I let myself be carried away by her and defiled the bed of my father Jacob. 7 I assure you that he inflicted a great punishment on my flanks for seven months, and if my father Jacob had not prayed to the Lord for me, for he was willing to destroy me! 8 I was then thirty years old when I did evil before the Lord, and I was sick to death for seven months. 9 Then I did penance before the Lord by my own will for seven years. 10 I drank neither wine nor strong drink, nor did meat enter my mouth, nor did I taste any delicious food while I mourned for my sin, so great was he! May such a thing never be done in Israel!<br />
        2 Now hear, my sons, what I saw about the seven deceitful spirits during my time of penitence. 2 Seven spirits has Beliar set against man; they are the ones who cause the actions of the youth. 3And seven others God gave to man since the creation, that through them the works of man might be accomplished. 4The first, the spirit of life, by which the human body is formed; second, the spirit of vision, by which desire is generated; 5the third, the spirit of hearing, by which instruction is transmitted; fourth, the spirit of smell, by which there is the sensitivity to draw in air and breath; 6the fifth, the spirit of speech, by which knowledge is generated; 7the sixth, the spirit of taste, by which the taking in of food and drink takes place, [and by these is created strength, for in food is its foundation]; 8the seventh, the spirit of semen and copulation, by which sin is introduced through the craving for pleasure. 9For this reason it is the last spirit of creation and the first of youth, because it is full of stupidity and leads the young, like a blind man, to the pit or, like a beast of burden, to the precipice.<br />
        3 -1In addition to all these there is an eighth spirit, the spirit of sleep, through which the ecstasy of nature and the image of death were created. 2To these spirits is mixed the spirit of error. 3The first, the spirit of fornication, has its seat in nature and in the senses; the second, the spirit of insatiability, in the belly; 4the third, the spirit of war, in the liver and bile; the fourth, the spirit of pleasure and charm, to appear beautiful by means of worthless things; 5the fifth, the spirit of pride, to boast and boast; the sixth, the spirit of deceit, perdition and envy, to feign words and to make them pass unnoticed by relatives and neighbors; 6the seventh, the spirit of injustice, through which robbery and theft occur, to carry out the desires of one's own heart. For injustice collaborates with the other spirits through bribery. 7[To these is added the spirit of sleep, the eighth, joined with delusions and fantasies.] 8In this way the young men are corrupted, darkening their minds away from the truth, not feeling according to the law of God nor obeying the admonitions of their fathers, just as it was with me in my youth.<br />
        9 But now, my sons, love the truth, and it will protect you. This is my teaching, listen to Reuben your father. 10Do not attach importance to the outward appearance of a woman; do not stay alone with a married woman or waste your time on women's affairs. 11If I had not seen Bala bathing in a secluded place, I would not have fallen into such great wickedness. 12From the moment my mind conceived of female nakedness, it did not allow me to sleep until I committed the abomination. 13While my father Jacob was away from his father Isaac and us at Gader near Ephrathah in the region of Bethlehem, Bala was lying drunk and sleeping naked in her bedroom. 14So I went in and saw her naked and committed wickedness, leaving her asleep and going outside. 15Immediately an angel of the Lord revealed my wickedness to my father Jacob. When he came home, he mourned for me and did not touch her again.<br />
        4 Do not look at the beauty of women or think about their affairs. Instead, walk with simplicity of heart and fear of the Lord. Keep busy at work, turning to your books and flocks, until the Lord gives you a partner of his choosing, so that you will not be like me. 2 Until the death of our father, I did not dare to look at Jacob's face or speak to any of my brothers for fear of their reproach. 3 And to this day I am tormented by my conscience because of my sin. 4 But my father comforted me by praying to God that his anger might turn away from me, as the Lord had commanded me. From then on, I repented and kept watch and did not sin. 5 Therefore, my sons, keep everything I command you, and you will never sin. 6 Lust is a ruin to the soul, He draws people away from God and draws them closer to idols. He continually deceives the mind and judgment, and casts young men into Hades before their time. 7Many have been ruined by lust. Even if he is old or of noble birth, he makes himself ridiculous and derisory before Beliar and mankind. 8Joseph found favor with the Lord and mankind because he kept himself away from women and kept his mind free from all fornication. 9Although the Egyptian woman tried him many times, summoned magicians, and offered him love potions, his good judgment would not allow any evil desire. 10Therefore the God of my fathers saved him from hidden and open dangers of death. 11If lust does not take hold of your mind, not even Beliar will overcome you.<br />
        5 Women are wicked, my children. Since they have no power or strength over men, they deceive them by the artifice of their beauty to draw them to themselves. 2They subdue those who cannot be deceived by their appearance. 3The angel of the Lord also spoke to me about women, and he taught me that women are overcome by the spirit of lust more than men. They plot against them in their hearts, and by their adornments they lead them astray, beginning with their minds. They sow poison with their looks, and then they enslave them by their actions. 4A woman cannot conquer a man by force, but she deceives him by the art of a prostitute. 5Flee therefore from fornication, my sons, and command your wives and daughters not to adorn their heads or faces, for eternal punishment is reserved for every woman who uses such deceit. 6In this way they deceived the Watchers before the flood. Because they saw them so often, they were inflamed with desire for them and conceived the act already in their minds. They were transformed into men and appeared to them when they were with their husbands. 7The women were inwardly attracted to these images and gave birth to giants. The Watchers appeared to them in size reaching to heaven.<br />
        6 -1Keep yourselves from fornication, and if you wish to keep your minds clean, keep your senses away from women. 2Also command them not to frequent the company of men, so that their minds may also be pure. 3Many sexual relations, even if they do not commit impiety, are an incurable disease for women, and for us a perpetual defilement before Beliar. 4Lust possesses neither wisdom nor piety, and envy resides in its desire.<br />
        5Therefore you will envy the sons of Levi and will try to raise yourselves above them, but you will not be able. 6God will take vengeance on him, and you will die a bad death. 7To Levi and Judah the Lord gave the leadership, and with them also to me, Dan, and Joseph, to be the leaders. 8Therefore I command you to listen to Levi, for he knows the law of the Lord. He will give you precise instructions for the judgments and sacrifices for all Israel until the end of time, for he is the anointed high priest spoken of by the Lord. 9I adjure you by the God of heaven that each one of you speak the truth to his neighbor and have love for his brother. 10Come near to Levi with humility of heart, so that you may receive the blessing from his lips. 11He will bless Israel and Judah, because the Lord has decided to reign through him over all peoples. 12Bow down to his descendants, for he will die for you in battles seen and unseen and will be your king forever.<br />
        7 - 1Reuben died after giving these instructions to his sons. 2They placed him in an urn until they brought him out of Egypt and buried him in Hebron, in the double cave, where his fathers rested.<br />

        <h2 dir="ltr" >SIMEON'S WILL</h2>
        
        <h3 dir="ltr" >On envy</h3>
        
        <p>1 -1This is a copy of the words of Simeon, as he spoke to his sons before he died, after he had lived one hundred and twenty years, at which time Joseph died. 2His sons came to visit him during his illness. Gathering his strength, he sat up, kissed them, and said to them,<br />
        2 -1Listen, my children, to Simeon your father,<br />
        and hear what is in my heart.<br />
        2I was the second son of Jacob;<br />
        my mother Leah named me Simeon ,<br />
        because the Lord heard her prayer.<br />
        3I grew up extremely strong;<br />
        I did not shrink from any action,<br />
        nor was I afraid of any work.<br />
        4My heart was hard,<br />
        my chest indomitable ,<br />
        and my bowels merciless.<br />
        [5For the Most High gives courage to both the souls and the bodies of men.] 6At that time I was jealous of Joseph because our father loved him, 7and my anger was strengthened with the idea of ​​​​annihilating him. The prince of error sent me the spirit of envy and blinded my mind so that I would not regard him as a brother or have pity on Jacob my father. 8But the God of his fathers sent his angel and saved him from my hand. 9I was on my way to Shechem to bring ointment for the flocks, and Reuben to Dotaim, where our storehouse of utensils and provisions was, when Judah my brother sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites. 10When Reuben came, he was displeased, for he wanted to save him and bring him to his father. 11But I was angry with Judah for sparing him, and for five months I was angry with him for this. 12But the Lord restrained me and made me unable to use my hands; my right hand was withered for seven days. 13Then I knew, my sons, that this had happened to me because of Joseph. I repented and burst into tears and prayed to the Lord that my hand might be restored to me and that I might be free from all impurity, envy, and foolishness. 14Then I realized that out of envy I had tried to commit an evil deed in the sight of the Lord and of my father Jacob against Joseph, my brother.<br />
        3 "My sons, beware of the spirits of error and envy. 2 It takes over the entire mind of men and prevents them from eating or drinking or doing good works. 3 Envy always suggests the destruction of the object of envy. The object of envy flourishes everywhere, but the envious person withers. 4 For two years I afflicted my soul with fasting for fear of the Lord. I realized that freedom from envy is obtained only by the fear of God. 5 If anyone takes refuge in the Lord, the evil spirit flees from him and his mind becomes sharper. 6From that moment on he sympathizes with the envied, does not condemn those who love him, and is thus free from envy.<br />
        4 -1My father continually asked about me, because he saw me with a sad face, to which I replied:<br />
        - My liver hurts.<br />
        2I was more grieved than anyone else because he had caused Joseph to be sold. 3When we went down to Egypt and he arrested me as a spy, I thought I was suffering justly, but I was not grieved. 4But Joseph was a good man, and the Spirit of God was with him. He was compassionate and merciful, so he did not hold a grudge against me, but showed his love for me as he did for my brothers. 5So, my sons, guard yourselves against every kind of jealousy and envy. Walk with a sincere spirit, so that God may pour out on your heads grace, glory and blessing, as you have seen in Joseph. 6He never reproached us for this deed in his life, but he loved us as his own soul, honored us more than his own sons, and gave us wealth, livestock and fruits of the earth. 7My dear sons, love each of you with a loving heart, and put away the spirit of envy from among you. 8This man makes the soul savage, destroys the body, fills the mind with anger and warlike ardour, inflames it to the point of shedding blood, drives thought out of itself and does not allow wisdom to act in men. He drives away sleep, agitates the soul and makes the body tremble. 9Even during sleep, a certain desire for evil gnaws at the soul with its fantasies, disturbs the soul with evil spirits and shakes the body. The soul awakens from sleep agitated and thus appears to men as possessed of an evil and poisonous spirit.<br />
        5 -1Since no evil dwelled in him, Joseph was of a beautiful figure and handsome in appearance, for his face betrays the restlessness of his spirit.<br />
        2My children,<br />
        make your hearts virtuous before the Lord,<br />
        straighten your ways before men<br />
        and you will find favor with God and men.<br />
        3Beware of fornication,<br />
        for it is the mother of all evil,<br />
        it turns you away from God<br />
        and brings you near to Beliar.<br />
        4I have read in the Book of Enoch that you and your children will perish for fornication and that they will try to harm Levi with the sword. 5But they will be powerless against him, for he will fight the battle of God and defeat all your armies. 6There will remain only a few divided between Levi and Judah, and none of you will succeed in commanding, as my father Jacob prophesied in his blessings.<br />
        6 - 1See that I have announced everything to you in advance so that you may be freed from your sins.<br />
        2But if you eradicate envy and hardness of heart from you,<br />
        then my bones will blossom like a rose in Israel,<br />
        and my flesh like a lily in Jacob;<br />
        my aroma will be like that of Lebanon;<br />
        and the saints who come from me<br />
        will multiply forever like cedars,<br />
        and their branches will spread far and wide.<br />
        3Then the offspring of Canaan will perish,<br />
        Amalek will no longer have any remnant;<br />
        all the Cappadocians will perish,<br />
        and all the Hittites will be destroyed.<br />
        4 The land of Ham will fail,<br />
        and all that people will perish.<br />
        Then the land will have rest from trouble,<br />
        and everything under heaven from war.<br />
        5 Then Shem will be covered with glory,<br />
        because the Lord God, the great one of Israel,<br />
        will appear on the earth [as a man] and<br />
        save Adam by himself.<br />
        6 All the spirits of error will be trampled underfoot,<br />
        and human beings will rule over evil spirits.<br />
        7 Then I will rise with joy<br />
        and praise the Most High for his wonderful works<br />
        [because God, taking a human body and eating with men, has saved them].<br />
        7 "Now, my sons, obey Levi and Judah. ​​Do not rise up against these two tribes, for from them will come the salvation of God. 2For the Lord will raise up from Levi a high priest, and from Judah a king, [God and man], who will save [all nations and] the people of Israel. 3Therefore I prescribe all these things for you, that you may pass them on to your children, that they may keep them forever.<br />
        8 After Simeon had finished teaching his sons these things, he slept with his fathers at the age of one hundred and twenty. 2His sons laid him in a coffin of incorruptible wood and carried his bones to Hebron, and during the war in Egypt they carried them there secretly. 3But the Egyptians kept Joseph's bones in the king's chambers, 4for the magicians had told them that when his bones came out, there would be darkness and gloom in Egypt—a great plague for the Egyptians—so that no one could recognize his brother by a lamp.<br />
        9 -1The sons of Simeon mourned for their father according to the laws of mourning and remained in Egypt until the day of their departure by the hand of Moses.</p>
        
        <p>Appendix</p>
        
        <p>Expansion of Slavic text (S1.2) after TestSim 8.3 (text by N. Tichonravov).</p>
        
        <p>Hear then, O Jew, what Simeon says. I have seen in the Books of Enoch that you and your children will be corrupted by fornication, that is, not knowing the Son of God, and being scattered among the nations, they will sin against Levi. This means that the Jews pierced Jesus Christ, the high priest according to the order of Levi, with a spear. But they could not against Levi, since he wages war for the Lord.<br />
        Confess, O Jew, and consider the Lord's struggle, inasmuch as you have opposed him. In doing so, you have bound him who suffered of his own free will on the cross, and you have placed him in the tomb, sealing it. But he rose again, unsealed and uncorrupted, for the sealed tomb could not hold back the Godhead, but, as our father Jacob prophesied in his blessing, it was not possible for them (to prevent?) him from blessing the nations.<br />
        Simeon continued speaking to his sons, that is, to free your souls from sin. Simeon then prophesies and makes known the coming of Christ. By this he purifies your soul from every kind of evil deed of the Hebrew race . . . (that is) if you will turn away from envy and pride. Then Simeon struggled with his sons to turn them away from envy and pride, but he could not stop them, for the Jews were filled with envy and pride. They bound Jesus and led him before Pilate to be judged. Pilate said, “I find no fault in him.”<br />
        Simeon said,<br />
        “If you will turn away from envy and pride, my bones will blossom like roses, and my flesh like a lily in Jacob; my scent will be wonderful and will increase like a sacred cedar. Why then is the cedar called sacred or why is it sanctified? With the eyes of wisdom the great patriarchs saw that Jesus was the Son of God and was crucified on cypress, pine and cedar. For this reason the cedar was called holy. My word (endures) forever, that is, the prophecy about Christ, until the final moment of its branches, when they become great. This means that the name of Christ will spread to the Gentiles. Then there will be a glorious sign, when the Lord, the great God, will appear on earth as a man saving Adam. Consider how he will save Adam by himself, because Adam was the first man and had fallen by transgressing the divine commandment. Therefore God became man, taking his flesh from a virgin, saving nature and man by himself. He raised Adam up. Then he said:<br />
        ―All the spirits of error will be given to him for his temptation, but men will rule over the evil spirits.<br />
        And when the Lord ascended, He sent His Holy Spirit upon the holy angels and gave them power and strength, and by the words of the Lord they will drive out the spirits of error. Therefore we hold the sacred bones in (our) hands to this day. By the work of the Holy Spirit the impure souls (i.e., the impure spirits) are dispelled like the man. Then He said:<br />
        "Then I will rise again with joy and bless the Most High for his wonders. Consider the roar of the force, when the earth trembled at the crucifixion of the Lord. The graves were opened; the dead were raised and all blessed the Most High for his wonders, just as the Lord said, who is incarnated, as with men, and saves them.<br />
        Then He said:<br />
        "Obey Levi; in Judah you will be redeemed. Do not rise against these two tribes, for from them will arise for you the salvation of God. God will raise up from Levi a high priest, and from Judah a king and a man. He will save the tribes of Israel and all men. Consider, you who are wretched, that the Lord will raise up for you a high priest from Levi. The Lord has said one as high priest, because He clothed him with flesh, and he was like a priest according to (the order) of Levi. So He said (this) to all the peoples and to the tribes of Israel. Then many Israelites were saved from among them. Of the most outstanding apostles there were twelve . . . and nine of the disciples . . . and many others, without number, were sanctified by believing in God. You (on the other hand), you who are wretched, will be scattered among all nations with insults, ill-treatment and disgrace.<br />
        "Therefore," he said, "I command you, my children, so that you may transmit to your children (all) what I have shown you, so that you may keep it for (all) your generations." Thus I said.<br />

        <h2 dir="ltr" >TESTAMENT OF LEVI</h2>
        
        <h3 dir="ltr" >On Priesthood and Pride</h3>
        
        <p>1 -1A copy of the words of Levi, of what he commanded his sons before his death, of all they were to do and what would happen to them until the day of judgment. 2 He was still in good health when he called them to him, for it had been revealed to him that he was going to die. When they were gathered together, he spoke to them thus:<br />
        2 -1“I, Levi, was conceived in Hanan and born there; then I came with my father to Shechem. 2I was young, about twenty years old, when Simeon and I took vengeance on Emmor for our sister Dinah. 3As we tended our flocks in Abelmaul, the spirit of the wisdom of the Lord came upon me, and I saw how all men had corrupted their ways, and how wickedness had built up (among them) her ramparts and wickedness had her seat in her towers. 4I felt sorry for mankind and prayed to the Lord (to show me) how I could be saved. 5Then a sleep fell upon me, and I saw a high mountain. [This was the Shield Mountain in Abelmaul.] 6Then the heavens were opened, and an angel of God said to me,<br />
        “Levi, go in.”<br />
        7I went up from the first heaven to the second and saw a mass of water hanging between it and that. 8Then I saw the third heaven, much brighter and more brilliant than the other two, for there was in it an unlimited light. 9I asked the angel,<br />
        “Why is this so?”<br />
        He replied,<br />
        “Do not be surprised at this; when you have gone higher, you will see four other heavens brighter and purer (than these).<br />
        10You will be close to the Lord,<br />
        you will be his servant,<br />
        you will announce his mysteries to men<br />
        and you will proclaim the future redemption of Israel.<br />
        [11Through you and Judah the Lord will appear among men, saving all mankind.]<br />
        12You will live from the Lord’s portion; he will be your field and vineyard, fruit, gold and silver.<br />
        3 -1Hear now (what I am going to tell you) about the seven heavens. The lowest is the saddest, since it beholds all the injustices of men. 2The second contains fire, snow and ice, prepared for the day when the Lord gives the order, in the course of the righteous judgment of God. In it are found all the spirits that lead the wicked to their punishment. 3In the third are the forces of the armies, ready on the day of judgment to take vengeance on the spirits of error and Beliar. Those who are in the fourth heaven, above these, are holy. 4In the highest of all dwells the Great Glory, in the Holy of Holies superior to all Holiness. 5In the next heaven are the angels of the presence of the Lord, his servants, who intercede before the Lord for all the sins of the righteous committed inadvertently. 6They offer to the Lord a sacrifice of sweet odor, a reasonable and bloodless offering. 7The lowest of these are the angels who bring the answers to their companions from the presence of God. 8The next are the thrones and dominions, and hymns to God are sung continually, 9for when the Lord directs His gaze upon us, we are all shaken. The heavens, the earth, and the abysses tremble at the presence of His greatness. 10But the sons of men who are insensitive to all this do not perceive this reality, and they sin and provoke the Most High to anger.<br />
        4 -1Know then that the Lord will judge mankind, for<br />
        though the rocks be split,<br />
        the sun be turned into darkness,<br />
        the waters be dried up,<br />
        the fire be cooled, and<br />
        all creation be troubled.<br />
        Though the immortal spirits be annihilated<br />
        [and Hades be stripped by the sufferings of the Most High],<br />
        mankind, being disobedient, will continue in their wickedness.<br />
        Therefore they will be punished in the judgment.<br />
        2The Most High has heard your prayer<br />
        to turn you from wickedness,<br />
        so that you may be his son, servant and minister before him.<br />
        3You will make the bright light of wisdom shine in Jacob,<br />
        and you will be like the sun to all the descendants of Israel.<br />
        4God will bless you and<br />
        your descendants until the Lord visits<br />
        all nations [through the tender<br />
        mercy of his Son] forever.<br />
        [But your sons will lay their hands on him and impale him.]<br />
        5For this reason you have been given will and understanding,<br />
        so that you may instruct your children in these things.<br />
        6For whoever blesses him will be blessed,<br />
        and those who curse him will perish.<br />
        5 Then the angel opened the gates of heaven for me, and I saw the holy temple and the Most High on a throne of glory. 2 Then he said to me,<br />
        “Levi, I have given you the blessings of the priesthood until I come to live among Israel.”<br />
        3 Then the angel brought me to the ground and gave me a shield and a sword. He said to me,<br />
        “Avenge yourself on Shechem for Dinah; I will be with you, for the Lord has sent me.”<br />
        4 Then I killed the sons of Emmor, just as it is written on the tablets of heaven. 5 I asked him,<br />
        “Please, my lord, tell me your name, so that I may call upon you in times of trouble.”<br />
        6 He said to me,<br />
        “I am the angel who intercedes for the people of Israel, so that they will not be destroyed, for all the evil spirits are attacking them.”<br />
        7 Then I woke up and praised the Most High with the angel who intercedes for the people of Israel and for all the righteous.<br />
        6 As I was going to my father's house, I found a bronze shield, and that is where the mountain near Gebal, on the right side of Abilah, got its name. 2 All these things were in my heart. 3 My father, my brother Reuben, and I decided that Reuben should tell the sons of Emmor to be circumcised, for he was burning with jealousy because of the wickedness they had committed against Israel. 4 I killed Shechem first, and Simeon killed Emmor. 5 Then my brothers came and put the city to the sword.<br />
        6 When my father heard what had happened, he was angry and grieved, because they had been circumcised only to die. So he did something different in his blessings. 7 We sinned, for we acted against his will. That day I became sick. 8But I saw that the Lord had condemned Shechem, because they were going to do to Sarah what they had done to our sister Dinah. But the Lord prevented them. 9In the same way they had persecuted Abraham our father when he was a foreigner, and they had harmed his sheep when they were pregnant, and they had severely mistreated Jebleh, the servant born in the house. 10In the same way they dealt with all the foreigners, seizing their wives by force and driving them out of the country. 11But the wrath of the Lord fell upon them in all its consequences.<br />
        7 Then I said to my father:<br />
        “Do not be angry, my lord, for the Lord will destroy the Canaanites by your hand and give their land to you and your descendants.” 2From today Shechem will be called the city of fools, for as one mocks a fool, so we mock them, 3for they had done something foolish with Israel, defiling our sister.<br />
        4We took our sister, set up our tents, and went to Bethel.<br />
        8 -1When seventy days had passed, I saw there a vision as before. 2I saw seven men dressed in white. They said to me,<br />
        “Get up! Put on the priestly garments, the crown of righteousness, the breastplate of wisdom, the robe of truth, the diadem of faith, the mitre of sign, and the ephod of prophecy.<br />
        3Each of them carried an object, and they placed it on me and said to me,<br />
        “From now on you are a priest of the Lord, you and your descendants forever.”<br />
        4The first anointed me with holy oil and gave me the scepter of judgment. 5The second washed me with pure water, fed me with most holy bread and wine, and clothed me with a glorious, holy garment. 6The third touched me with a linen cloth like an ephod. 7The fourth girded me with a sash like purple. 8The fifth gave me a fruitful olive branch. 9The sixth put a crown on my head. 10The seventh put the priestly diadem on me and filled my hands with incense to minister before the Lord.<br />
        11They all said to me:<br />
        “Levi, your descendants will be divided into three divisions, as a sign of the glory of the Lord who is to come. 12The first will be a great portion; there will be no one greater than it. 13The second will be the priesthood. 14The third will be named after a new king from Judah [creating a new priesthood according to the style of the peoples for all nations. 15His coming is unpredictable, like that of a prophet of the Most High], coming from the lineage of Abraham our father. 16Everything that is desirable in Israel will be yours and your descendants; you will eat everything that is beautiful in appearance, and your descendants will share the table of the Lord. 17From her will come chief priests, judges, and scribes, and from among you will come the kings of Israel. 18When I woke up, I saw that this vision was the same as the one before. 19I kept<br />
        it all in my heart and did not tell anyone on earth about it.<br />
        9 Two days later, Judah and I went up with our father to visit Isaac. 2My grandfather blessed me according to what had been promised me in the visions, but he would not go with us to Bethel. 3When we arrived there, my father Jacob had a vision about me: that I would be his priest before God. 4He got up early in the morning and offered a tenth of everything to the Lord through me. 5We came to Hebron to live there. 6Isaac continually exhorted me to keep the law of the Lord in mind, as the angel of the Lord had instructed me. 7He also taught me the ordinances of the priesthood, sacrifices, burnt offerings, first fruits, freewill offerings and peace offerings. 8He taught me continually every day and kept busy before the Lord for my sake. 9He said to me:<br />
        “Be on your guard, son, against the spirit of fornication, for it is persistent and will profane the sanctuary through your offspring. 10Take a wife in your youth, blameless and undefiled, not of foreign descent. 11Wash yourself before you enter the sanctuary, and wash yourself at the time of your sacrifice, and wash again when you desecrate the offering. 12Offer to the Lord the wood of twelve evergreen trees, as Abraham taught me. 13Offer sacrifices to the Lord of every animal and pure bird. 14Offer the firstfruits of every firstborn and of the wine. You shall season all the sacrifices with salt.<br />
        10 “So, sons, observe all that I command you, for I have told you what I have heard from my fathers. 2I am innocent of your wickedness and your transgressions which you will commit at the end of the age, acting wickedly and causing Israel to err and bringing great evil on them from the Lord. 3You will act so wickedly in Israel that Jerusalem will not be able to stand because of your wickedness. 4You will be scattered as captives among the Gentiles, and you will be a reproach, a curse, and a contempt. 5The house that the Lord will choose will be called Jerusalem, as it is written in the book of Enoch the righteous.<br />
        11 "1When I was twenty-eight years old, I took a wife; her name was Melcah. 2She conceived and gave birth to a son and named him Gershan, because we were strangers in our own land. 3I saw in a vision about him that he would not be among the first. 4Kaath was born when I was thirty-five years old, about sunset. 5I saw him in a vision standing on high in the midst of the entire assembly. 6So I named him Kaath [which means the beginning of greatness and advancement]. 7Melcah bore me a third son, Merari, in the fortieth year of my life. Because his mother had difficulty in giving birth, I named him Merari, which means “my bitterness.” [He did indeed die.] 8Jochabed was born in Egypt in the sixty-fourth year of my life, for he was well-known among my brothers at that time.<br />
        12Gershan took a wife, and she bore him Lomri and Shimei. 2The sons of Kaath were Ambran, Issaar, Hebron, and Uzziel. 3The names of Merari's sons were Mooli and Omushi. 4In the ninety-fourth year of my life Ambran took my daughter Jochebed as a wife (he and my daughter were born on the same day). 5I was eight years old when I entered the land of Canaan; eighteen when I killed Shechem, nineteen when I was ordained a priest, and twenty-eight when I took a wife; when I was forty years old I entered Egypt. 6You, my sons, are the third generation. 7When I was one hundred and eighteen years old, Joseph died.<br />
        13 "Now, my sons, this I command you:<br />
        Fear our Lord with all your heart;<br />
        walk in simplicity according to his law.<br />
        2Teach your children to read,<br />
        so that they may have wisdom throughout their lives,<br />
        reading the law of God without ceasing.<br />
        3 For everyone who knows the law of the Lord will have honor;<br />
        he will not be a stranger wherever he goes.<br />
        4 Indeed, he will make many friends, more than his fathers.<br />
        Many men will long to be his servant<br />
        and to hear the law from his lips.<br />
        5 Do what is right, my children, on earth,<br />
        and you will find it in heaven.<br />
        6 Sow good in your souls,<br />
        that you may find it in your lives.<br />
        For if you sow evil,<br />
        you will reap anxiety and tribulation.<br />
        7 Diligently acquire wisdom with the fear of God.<br />
        For though they lead you into slavery,<br />
        though cities and their lands be destroyed,<br />
        though gold and silver and all riches be destroyed, yet<br />
        no one will be able to rob the wise of wisdom,<br />
        except the blindness of ungodliness and sinful stubbornness.<br />
        8 Wisdom will be to him a light among enemies,<br />
        a home in a foreign land, and a friend in the midst of adversaries.<br />
        9If you teach this and put it into practice,<br />
        you will sit on the throne with kings,<br />
        like our brother Joseph.<br />
        14 - 1Children, I know from the book of Enoch that in the end you will sin against the Lord, throwing your hands into every kind of wickedness. But your brothers will be ashamed of you, and you will become a reproach in the eyes of the Gentiles. [2Your father Israel will be clean from the ungodliness of the high priests, who will lay their hands on the savior of the world.] 3The sky is purer than the earth, and you, the lights of Israel, are like the sun and the moon. 4What will the Gentiles do if ungodliness turns you into darkness and you bring a curse on your race... on the one who shines the light of the law, given to you for the enlightenment of all mortals! This is the one you intend to annihilate by teaching commandments contrary to the precepts of God! 5You will plunder the Lord’s offerings, steal from his portions, and seize the choicest offerings before the sacrifice, devouring them with prostitutes in contempt of the law. 6You will teach the commandments of the Lord out of greed, defile married women, defile the virgins of Jerusalem, and join prostitutes and adulteresses. You will take the daughters of the Gentiles as wives, purifying them with unlawful purification, and your union will be like that of Sodom and Gomorrah in wickedness. 7You will be puffed up with pride because of your priesthood, being insolent against men. And not only that, but even against the commandments of God. 8You will be filled with pride, mocking what is holy with laughter and contempt.<br />
        15 Because of all this, the temple that the Lord chooses will be deserted and desecrated, You will be led into slavery among the nations. 2You will be an abomination to them, and the righteous judgment of God will condemn you to everlasting shame and disgrace. 3And all who see you will flee from you. 4Were it not for Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, our ancestors, not a single one of my descendants would be left on earth.<br />
        16 “I have read in the book of Enoch that you will wander for seventy weeks and that you will defile the priesthood and profane the sacrifices. 2You will pervert the law and despise the words of the prophets. Because of your evil ways you will persecute the righteous and hate the devout, abhorring the words of those who speak the truth. 3[The man who will renew the law by the power of the Most High will be called an impostor and in the end—just as you had planned—you will kill him without knowing his dignity, and in your wickedness you will allow innocent blood to be shed on your own heads.] 4Because of him your sanctuary will be deserted, unclean to the ground. 5Nowhere will your place be clean. You will be scattered among the Gentiles, a curse to them until he visits you again and, filled with compassion, welcomes you [in faith and in water].<br />
        17 - Since you have heard about the seventy weeks, now hear about the priesthood. 2 In every jubilee there will be a priesthood. In the first, the first anointed for the priesthood will be great and will speak to God as to a father, and his priesthood will be perfected with the Lord. [And on the day of his joy he will be resurrected for the salvation of the world.] 3 In the second jubilee, the anointed one will be seized with pain for those he loves, but his priesthood will be honorable, and everyone will honor him. 4 The third priest will be received with sorrow. 5 The fourth will live in pain, because wickedness will be heaped upon him without limit, for all the inhabitants of Israel will hate their neighbor. 6 The fifth will be received in a time of darkness; 7 so will the sixth and the seventh. 8In their time there will be such a desecration that I cannot speak of it before God or man; they who commit it will know it. 9 Therefore they will be subjected to slavery and plundering; their land and their goods will disappear. 10But in the fifth week they will return to their desolate land and rebuild the house of the Lord. 11In the seventh week there will come idolatrous, quarrelsome, covetous, arrogant, ungodly, licentious priests, and corrupters of children and animals.<br />
        18 -1After the Lord has taken vengeance on them, the priesthood will be discontinued.<br />
        2Then the Lord will raise up a new priest,<br />
        to whom all the words of the Lord will be revealed.<br />
        He will judge righteously on earth for many days.<br />
        [3His star will rise in the sky like a king, shining as the light of knowledge like the sun during the day, and he will be exalted in the world until he is received.]<br />
        4He will shine like the sun on the earth,<br />
        he will remove all darkness under heaven,<br />
        and there will be peace throughout the world.<br />
        5The heavens will rejoice in his days,<br />
        and the earth will be glad.<br />
        The clouds will exult;<br />
        the knowledge of the Lord will pour out on the earth<br />
        like water from the seas;<br />
        and the angels of glory [from the face of the Lord]<br />
        will rejoice in him.<br />
        [6The heavens will open] and from the glorious temple sanctification will come down upon him with the voice of the Father, like that of Abraham to Isaac.<br />
        7The glory of the Most High will be granted to him, and the spirit of wisdom and holiness will rest upon him [in water].<br />
        8He will transmit to his true children the greatness of the Lord forever,<br />
        and he will have no other successor from generation to generation eternally.<br />
        9During his priesthood, the Gentile peoples of the earth will abound in knowledge<br />
        and be enlightened by the grace of the Lord.<br />
        [But Israel will be diminished by ignorance and filled with darkness in its mourning.]<br />
        During his priesthood, sin will be eliminated, and the wicked will cease from doing evil.<br />
        [But the righteous will find rest in him.]<br />
        10He will certainly open the gates of Paradise and will remove the threatening sword from Adam.<br />
        11He will give the saints food to eat from the tree of life, and the spirit of sanctification will be upon them.<br />
        12He will bind Beliar<br />
        and give power to his sons to trample evil spirits.<br />
        13The Lord will rejoice in his sons<br />
        and will take pleasure in those he loves forever.<br />
        14Then Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob will rejoice. I too will rejoice, and all the saints will be clothed with joy.<br />
        19 "Now, my sons, listen to this: Choose for yourselves between darkness and light, between the law of the Lord and the works of Beliar."<br />
        2We all said to our father,<br />
        "We will walk before the Lord according to his law."<br />
        3Our father said,<br />
        “The Lord and his angels are witnesses; I and all of you are witnesses to the words of my mouth.”<br />
        We replied,<br />
        “We are witnesses.”<br />
        4So our father finished giving orders and recommendations to his sons. He spread out his feet and joined his parents after living a hundred and thirty-seven years. 5They placed him in a coffin and buried him in Hebron, next to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</p>

        <p>II</p>
        
        <p>Here we give two additions from ms. ea TestLev 2,3 and 18,2. In the latter we give priority to the Greek text and only print the corresponding Aramaic (and Syriac) fragments where they occur without a Greek parallel. Both traditions probably come from a lost, perhaps Hebrew, original, since they give the impression of being independent of each other, as evidenced by their various internal corruptions. The Aramaic version is usually more critically insecure. As base texts we use those printed in appendices III and following of Charles's critical edition (1908), together with that of De Jonge.</p>
        
        <p>1. Expansion of ms. and TestLev 2.3</p>
        
        <p>1Then I washed my clothes and purified them in clean water. 2I washed myself thoroughly in living water and made my behavior completely upright. 3Then I lifted my eyes and my face toward heaven, opened my mouth and spoke a word. 4I stretched out my hands and fingers toward the truth and prayed before the saints:<br />
        5“Lord, you know all hearts, but you alone perceive the thoughts of the mind. 6My children are with me now; grant me the ways of truth. 7Remove from me, Lord, the unrighteous spirit and the evil thought, and remove from me fornication and anger. 8Show me, Lord, the Holy Spirit and give me good counsel, wisdom and knowledge 9that I may do what pleases you, find favor with you and praise the words you speak to me. 10May Satan have no power to turn me from your path. 11Have mercy on me and bring me near to you, that I may be your servant and serve you faithfully. 12Let the wall of your peace surround me, and let the stronghold of your power protect me from all evil. 13Grant me (?) . . . and blot out wickedness from under heaven and put it away from the face of the earth. 14Purge my heart, Lord, from all impurity, and I will rise to you (?). 15Do not turn your face away from the son of your servant Jacob. You, Lord, blessed Abraham, my father, and Sarah, my mother. 16You promised to give them a righteous and blessed offspring forever. 17Hear the voice of your servant Levi, who desires to be near you. 18Make your words known to me and to my children forever, that we may judge with equity forever. And do not turn your face away from the son of your servant Jacob.<br />
        I remained silent as I continued (inwardly) my plea.</p>
        
        <p>2. Aramaic fragments from the Cairo Genizah (TestLev 18.2)</p>
        
        <p>4. . . Peace, and all the most desirable of the firstfruits of the earth (may serve as) food for you. But to the kingdom of the sword (belong) strife, war, battle, disaster, rage, slaughter, and famine. 5Sometimes you will be able to eat, and at other times you will be hungry. At one time you will work, and at another you will rest. At one time you will sleep, and at another sleep will flee from your eyes. 6Now consider how He has made you greater than all and how We have granted you the greatness of eternal peace. 7Two weeks passed when I awoke from my sleep. Then I said, “One vision is like another.” And I was amazed that the whole vision was about me.<br />
        So I hid everything in my heart and revealed it to no one. 8We went up to my father Isaac, and he also blessed me in the same way. 9Then when Jacob saw . . . he offered a tenth of all he had according to the rite (which he had formulated). . . so I became the first to the forefront of the priesthood, (so) to me (as the only one) among all my brothers he gave an offering . . . to God. He clothed me with the priestly garments and showered my hands (with gifts). I was appointed priest of the eternal God (?). I offered all my sacrifices and blessed my father with all my might, and my brothers too. 10Then they all blessed me. (Our) father blessed me too, and I finished offering my offerings at Bethel.</p>
        
        <p>3. Expansion of ms. e (Greek) to TestLev 18.2</p>
        
        <p>11We went up from Bethel and stayed at the tent of our grandfather Abraham and with our father Isaac. 12He saw us all and blessed us with joy. 13When he learned that I was serving as priest to the Lord, the Lord of heaven, he began to teach me the laws of the priesthood. He said to me:<br />
        14“Son of Levi, guard yourself from all uncleanness. Your rights are higher than those of any other human being. 15I am now proclaiming to you the true law. I will not hide anything from you, but I will teach you. 16Guard yourself from sexual intercourse, from all impurity and fornication. 17Take a wife from my lineage and do not profane your offspring with prostitutes. For you are of holy descent . . . sanctify your offspring . . . you will be a holy priest to Abraham’s offspring.” 18You are near the Lord and his sanctuary. Keep your body clean from all human impurity. 19When you enter the sanctuary, first bathe yourself with water and then put on the priestly garments. 20When you have put on your clothes, wash your hands and feet again before you approach the altar with the offerings. 21When you offer the gifts that are to be presented on the altar, wash your hands and feet again. 22First offer the split wood, making sure it is clean from impurity.<br />
        23He indicated to me twelve kinds of wood to be offered on the altar. They produce a sweet-smelling smoke. 24These are their names: cedar, laurel, mastic, fir, pine, ash, juniper, fig, cypress, bay and balsam. 25He named these kinds because they are to be placed under the burnt offering on the altar. When the fire begins to burn on them, pour the blood over the sides of the altar. 26Wash yourself again, removing the blood from your hands and feet. Then begin to offer the salted members. 27Present the head first, covering it with fat so that no blood can be seen on it. 28Next the neck, then the shoulder blades, then the breast and sides, then the hip and shoulder blades, then the clean hooves with the entrails. 29Everything must be well salted and generously proportioned, as is appropriate for each. 30Then offer flour mixed with oil, pour in wine, and let the incense smoke over it. Perform your task in order, and let your offering be acceptable and fragrant before the Sovereign Lord. 31Whatever you do, perform it in order, according to weight and measure. Do not add anything that is not appropriate . . . this is how wood is properly offered on the altar. 32For a good-sized bull, a talent of wood is needed; but if only the fat is offered, six minas. For a second bull, fifty minas; but if only its fat, five. 33For a good-sized calf, forty minas. 34For a ram or a goat, thirty minas, and for the fat, three. 35For a lamb or a goat, twenty minas, and for its fat, two. 36For a good-sized yearling lamb or goat, fifteen minas, and for its fat, a mina and a half. 37A large bull must be given enough salt to season its flesh. Then offer it on the altar. One measure is enough for a bull; use the rest to salt the hide. 38For the second bull take five-sixths of a measure, and for the bull, half that. 39For the ram and the goat, half that. 40For the lamb and the goat, one-third, together with the corresponding flour. 41For the large bull and for the second, together with the bull, take one measure of flour. 42For the ram and the goat, two parts, and for the lamb and the goat, one-third of the measure. For the oil: 43one-third of a measure for the bull, mixed with the flour. 44For the ram, one-sixth, and for the male lamb and female lamb, one-eighth. The wine for the bull and the ram shall be dispensed according to the amount of oil; for the goat, pour it liberally. 45For the bull, take six shekels of incense; for the ram, half as much, and for the goat, a third. All the flour shall be kneaded together. 46If you offer it alone, not on the fat, you shall accompany it with two shekels of incense. A third of a measure is a third of an ephah. 47Two-thirds of a bath and a mina in weight are fifty shekels. A fourth part of a shekel is four termas in weight.The shekel is about sixteen therms and a measure of weight.<br />
        48“Now, my son, listen to my words and give ear to my advice. Do not let my words depart from your heart throughout your life, for you are a holy priest of the Lord, 49and your descendants will be priests. Command your sons to follow the rules I have given you today. 50This is what my father Abraham commanded me to do and to pass it on to my sons. 51Now, my son, I am glad that you have been chosen to be a holy priest and to offer sacrifices to the Sovereign Lord, as is fitting according to what is commanded. 52Whenever you receive a gift (of any kind of meat to be offered as a sacrifice to the Lord), accept the wood according to the order I have prescribed for you, and likewise accept from their hands the salt, flour, wine and incense for the sacrifices. 53At all times, when you approach the altar, wash your hands and feet; when you leave the sanctuary, do not leave any traces of blood on your garments. Do not kindle a fire on the same day (?). 54Continually cleanse your hands and feet of (any remains of) flesh. 55Do not let any trace of blood and life be seen on you (?), for blood is the life of the flesh. 56When you prepare to eat meat at home, hide its blood in the ground before you eat it; so you will never eat blood. 57This is what my father Abraham commanded me, and this is what I have found about blood in the writings of Noah. 58My dear son, I assure you that your father loves you especially and that you are holy to the Lord Most High. You will be more beloved than all your brothers. 59Through your descendants blessings will be received on earth, and your lineage will be written forever in the memorial of the book of life. 60Your name and the name of your lineage will never be blotted out from it. 61My son Levi, your lineage will be blessed on earth for all generations.<br />
        62When four weeks had passed in my life, when I was twenty-eight years old, I took a wife from the descent of my father Abraham. Her name was Melcah, the daughter of Bathuel, the son of Laban, my mother's brother. 63She conceived by me and bore a first son, and I named him Gershan, for I said to myself, 'My offspring will be a stranger in the land of my birth. ' 64I saw in a vision that the child and his offspring would be cut off from the priesthood. 65I was thirty years old when he was born, in the tenth month, at sunset. 66Meloca conceived again, and after the proper time had elapsed, she bore a son, and I named him Kaath. 67When he was born, I saw that in him all the nations would be gathered, that he would be high priest, and that he and his offspring would rule over kings and the priesthood in Israel. 68Kaat was born when I was thirty-four years old, in the first month, on the first day, at sunrise. 69Then I joined myself to Melcah, and she conceived and bore me a third son, whom I named Merari, for I grieved for him.<br />
        70 (Aramaic only). In the fortieth year of my life she gave birth, in the third month. 71Then I went in to her again, and she conceived and bore me a daughter, and I named her Jochebed. I said to myself, “She has borne me (this daughter) for my honor, and she has also borne her for the glory of Israel.” 72In the sixty-fourth year of my life she gave birth to her, on the first day of the seventh month after we went up to Egypt. 73In the sixteenth year we entered the land of Egypt. To my sons were given as wives the daughters of my brothers, and in their time they bore them sons. 74The names of the sons of Gershan are: Libni and Shimei; and the names of the sons of Kaath: Amram, Hizhar, Hebron and Uzziel. The names of the sons of Merari are: Mahli and Musai. 75Amram married my daughter Jochebed while I was still alive, in the ninety-fourth year of my life. 76When Amram was born, I named him that, for at the time of his birth I said to myself, “This child [Amram] will lead the people out of the land of Egypt.” Therefore I named him “Exalted People.” 77On the same day, he and my daughter Jochebed were born.<br />
        <br />
        (Aramaic) 78I was eighteen years old when I went up to the land of Canaan. And I was eighteen when I killed Shechem and put an end to the workers of iniquity. 79When I was nineteen years old, I was ordained a priest, and when I was twenty-eight, I married a wife. 80I was fifty-eight when we went up to the land of Egypt. I lived there eighty-nine years. 81All the days of my life were one hundred and thirty-seven years.<br />
        (Syriac) Again (we ask): How long did Levi live? This is what he says in his testament. Levi says in his testament: 78I was eight years old when I went up to the land of Canaan. And I was eighteen when I killed Shechem and destroyed all the workers of iniquity. 79When I was nineteen years old I was consecrated a priest, and when I was twenty-eight I took a wife. 80I was forty years old when I went up to Egypt. I lived there ninety years. 81All the years of my life were one hundred and thirty-seven.<br />
        <br />
        (Aramaic) And (I was able to) see my descendants of the third generation before I died. 82In the one hundred and eighteenth year of my life, when Joseph my brother died, I called my sons and grandsons together and began to explain to them everything that was in my heart. 83I said thus to my sons:<br />
        —Hear the words of Levi your father<br />
        and listen to the precepts of the beloved of God.<br />
        84To you, my children, I give orders,<br />
        and to you I show the truth, my beloved.<br />
        85Let the sum total of your works be truth,<br />
        and righteousness abide among you forever.<br />
        86Let the truth . . .<br />
        and let its harvest be blessed.<br />
        87He who sows good, reaps well,<br />
        and he who sows evil, upon himself shall return his seed.<br />
        88But now, my children, instruct your children<br />
        in the book of instruction and wisdom,<br />
        and may wisdom enjoy perpetual honor among you.<br />
        89He who teaches wisdom will have glory in it,<br />
        and he who despises it will be given to disgrace.<br />
        90See, my children, Joseph my brother,<br />
        who teaches (with) the Scripture and (teaches) discipline and wisdom.<br />
        91 . . . he is not a stranger in it,<br />
        nor is he like a foreigner . . .<br />
        For all give him glory for it,<br />
        since they long to learn from his wisdom<br />
        92Many are his friends,<br />
        and many are those who greet him.<br />
        93They make him sit on a glorious throne<br />
        to hear their wise words.<br />
        94A great treasure of glory is wisdom<br />
        , and a great wealth for all who obtain it.<br />
        95Though mighty kings and numerous people,<br />
        an army (of) knights and many chariots,<br />
        come to conquer . . . the land and the city<br />
        and seize everything in it,<br />
        they will not be able to steal the treasure of wisdom<br />
        nor will they be able to find its secrets.</p>
        
        <p>4. Expansion of the Slavic text to TestLev 7,4<br />
        (Translation based on the edition of N. Tichonravov)</p>
        
        <p>Consider this thought, O Jew, and approach the vision of Levi, which he made manifest, as a wonderful angel descended from heaven. The angel said to Levi:<br />
        You will be close to the Lord and be his servant; you will reveal his secrets to men and you will announce him who wants to save Israel. You do not know, O Jew, the angel of the Lord who announces to your ancestors the salvation of Israel, for the word has not been revealed to you, namely, that the Lord (through the offspring) of Judah saves all mankind. Consider then, you wretched one, that it is not an angel nor a human being, nor (any other) mediator, but the Lord himself who saves us. This is what we made known to you from the beginning: that the Lord will be born of the tribe of Judah, of the virgin Mary. For Levi himself was (of the Levitical order) (!); therefore he was a priest of the people. For this reason the Lord was a priest, for the angel said to Levi:<br />
        “From you and from Judah the Lord will appear to men, saving all mankind without blood.<br />
        Consider how the angels of God do not offer the blood of bulls or goats as a sacrifice to the Lord, but give thanks to the Lord with a pure sacrifice. In the same way, we Christians also offer the Lord the body and blood (as) a pure offering according to the order of Melchizedek. Consider then also this and be convinced that the Lord judges the sons of men. It is not for you (only), you wretches, that the Lord executes his sentence with unquenchable fire, with the tireless worm, and by placing stones of offense (?) for you. For you nailed the Lord to the cross. And the sun,” he said, “was darkened. Did not the sun darken when you crucified the Lord, as the holy gospel says? Then there was darkness over the whole earth from the third hour until the ninth hour, and the waters were dried up, and Hades was taken prisoner.<br />
        Tell me then. When Hades was taken prisoner, what kind of armed enemies entered Hades? (It was not so,) but the Lord himself, after lying in the tomb, entered Hades, and freed Adam, the first-called, from that underground prison. For he was the Lord of heaven and earth; therefore he came, to take possession of Hades. But although he suffered, his nature was impassive, for by his suffering he granted impassibility to the human race. But ignorant men remain without justice. Who then, lacking understanding, opposed? You, unhappy ones! You, then, have remained in injustice. For this reason you will be condemned to torture. The Most High heard the prayer, he said. Turn away from injustice and become his son and servant. Consider then how the Son of God existed before him and served him, he said.<br />
        He will bless you and all your descendants until the Lord visits all nations, sending his Son in mercy forever. Your children laid their hands on him and mistreated him. Consider how the merciful God sent his Son to us forever, and how you, wretched men, laid your hands on him and mistreated the Son of God. For this reason, he said, you will be given intelligence so that you may instruct your children about it. Thus, he who blesses him will be blessed, and he who curses him will be destroyed. Remember: who is he who blesses the Son of God and who are those who truly believe in him? We Christians worship him, while you crucified him. Therefore you have truly brought destruction upon yourselves. You will perish, and a small part of you will be scattered throughout the world. This portion will receive no small burdens, sorrow and harm. Consider then what was said to Levi from heaven: “I have given you the blessing of purity until I come and dwell in Israel.”<br />
        But you, wretched ones, do not understand that the Lord is coming with the desire to save Israel. You have continually blasphemed the Lord, so that we, being elsewhere (?), might receive his divine law. But you, wretched ones, made like the old Satan by your pride, will fall into destruction.<br />

        <h2 dir="ltr" >TESTAMENT OF JUDAH</h2>
        
        <h3 dir="ltr" >On Courage, Greed and Fornication</h3>
        
        <p>1 -1A copy of Judah's words to his sons before his death. 2They all gathered together and went to him. Then he said to them:<br />
        3“I was my father's fourth son. My mother named me Judah, for she said to herself, ‘I thank the Lord that he has given me a fourth son. ’ 4I was quick and diligent in my youth and obeyed my father in everything, 5respecting my mother and her sister. 6When I became a man, my father blessed me: ‘You will be king and be successful in everything you do. ’<br />
        2 -1The Lord gave me favor in all my works, in the field and at home. 2When I realized that I could compete with the deer in speed, I hunted one and prepared it as food for my father. 3I outran gazelles and hunted everything in the plain. I seized a wild mare and tamed it. 4I killed a lion and tore a goat from its mouth. I dragged a bear by its legs and threw it over a cliff. I tore any wild animal that came against me as if it were a dog. 5I raced a wild boar, outran it, and tore it to pieces. 6A leopard fell on a dog in Hebron. I grabbed it by the tail and threw it like a javelin, so that it split in two. 7I grabbed a wild bull that was grazing in the region by its horns, circled it, blinded it, and struck it to the ground.<br />
        3When the two kings of the Canaanites came against my flocks, with many men around them, I ran alone against King Assyria, grabbed him, struck him on his greaves, threw him to the ground, and killed him. 2I also struck down the other king, Tappueh, who was riding on his horse. I scattered the entire army. 3Against King Achor, a giant who was riding from behind and in front of him, I lifted a stone weighing sixty pounds and threw it at his horse. I struck him and killed him. 4I fought with Achor for two hours and killed him as well. I split his shield in two and cut off his feet. 5As I was stripping off his armor, eight of his companions came out to fight me. 6I wrapped my cloak around my arm and slung stones at them. I killed four of them, and the rest fled. 7My father Jacob killed Beelisha, the leader of all the kings, a mighty giant twelve cubits tall. 8They were terrified and stopped fighting us. 9So my father was not distressed by wars, since I was among my brothers. 10For he had seen a vision concerning me, that a mighty angel followed me in all my actions, so that I could not be defeated.<br />
        4 In the south we had a fiercer war than at Shechem. I arrayed myself in battle array with my brothers, pursued a thousand men, and killed two hundred of them and four kings. 2I rushed against them over the wall and killed two more kings. 3So we liberated Hebron and recovered all those kings who had been captured.<br />
        5 The next day we went to Aretha, a fortified city, walled and inaccessible, and threatened to kill us. 2 Gad and I approached the city from the east, and Reuben and Levi from the west and south. 3 The men on the wall thought we were alone and rushed down against us. 4 Then my brothers secretly scaled the wall with pegs and entered the city without the enemy knowing. 5 We took the city at the point of the sword. Others had fled to the tower, but we set fire to it and took everything. 6 As we retreated, the men of Taphue fell upon our plunder of prisoners. We left it with our sons and fought them all the way to Taphue. 7 We killed them, burned their city, and plundered everything in it.<br />
        6 When we were near the waters of Cozeba, the men of Jobel came against us in battle. 2 We fought against them and killed their allies, the Shilonians, without giving them a chance to come out against us. 3 On the fifth day the men of Machir came against us to seize our plunder. We attacked them and defeated them in a fierce battle, for there were many brave men among them. We killed them before we had completed the climb. 4 When we approached their city, their women rolled stones at us from the top of the hill where the town was located. 5 Simeon and I hid behind us and seized the high ground and destroyed the entire city.<br />
        7 The next day we were told that the king of the city of Gaash was coming against us with a heavily armed army. 2 Dan and I, pretending to be Amorites, entered their city as allies. 3In the darkness of the night our brothers came, and we opened the gates to them and destroyed them and their property. We divided up all their wealth and tore down their three walls. 4We approached Tamnah, where the enemy kings' forces had gathered to flee. 5They insulted me and I became angry. I rushed toward the hilltop against them, while they slung me with arrows and stones. 6If Dan my brother had not fought with me, they would have killed me. 7But we rushed against them in great anger, and they all fled. They went another way and begged my father, who made peace with them. 8We did not harm them, but made a treaty and gave them back all our plunder. 9I built Tamnah, and my father, Rambael. 10I was twenty years old when this war took place. 11The Canaanites were afraid of me and my brothers.<br />
        8 I had many flocks, and I was the herdsman of Iran the Odolamite. 2 As I was going to him, I saw Barshan king of Odolamite, who prepared a banquet for us. He urged me to take his daughter Beshua as a wife. 3 She bore me Er, Onan, and Shelon. Two of them the Lord put to death childless. But Shelon lived, and you are his sons.<br />
        9 For eighteen years, from the time we came from Mesopotamia from Laban, we and my father kept peace with Esau his brother and with his sons. 2 When those years were over, when I was forty, my father's brother Esau came against us with a multitude of mighty men armed with might. 3 Esau fell under Jacob's bow and was carried to Mount Seir, and died on the way to Eiramna. 4We pursued the sons of Esau. They had a city with iron walls and bronze gates. We could not enter it, but we camped and besieged them. 5When they would not open the gates after twenty days, I brought a ladder before their eyes and put my shield over my head. I went up and was showered with stones weighing three talents. But I went up and killed four of the strongest of them. 6The next day Reuben and Gad came up and killed six others. 7Then they asked for peace with us. We agreed to our father's advice and accepted them as tributaries. 8They provided us with two hundred measures of grain, five hundred measures of oil, and one thousand five hundred measures of wine until we went down to Egypt.<br />
        10After these events, my son Er brought Tamar daughter of Aran from Mesopotamia and married her. 2But Er was wicked and had doubts about Tamar, because she was not from the land of Canaan. An angel of the Lord killed him on the third night. 3He did not know her, because he followed the wicked ways of his mother, for he did not want to have children by her. 4At the very time of the wedding feast I gave her to Onan as a wife. But he was wicked and did not know her, although he lived with her a year. 5When I threatened him, he did lie with her, but he let his sperm perish on the ground, as his mother had commanded. He also died because of his wickedness. 6Then I wanted to give her to Shelon as a wife, but my wife Beshua would not allow it. She was ill-willed because she was not of the daughters of Canaan like her.<br />
        11I knew that the lineage of Canaan was wicked, but the impulse of youth blinded my heart. 2I saw her as she poured out wine; drunkenness seduced me, and I fell at her feet. 3She went away while I was away and took a wife from the daughters of Canaan for Silon. 4When she learned what she had done, I cursed her in pain. 5She also died because of the iniquity of her sons.<br />
        12 After these events, two years later, when Tamar was a widow, she heard that I was going up to shear sheep. She put on her wedding dress and sat at the gate of the city of Enan. 2For there is a custom among the Amorites that a bride betrothed sits like a prostitute for seven days at the gate of the city. 3I was drunk and did not recognize her because of the effects of wine. Her beauty beckoned me because of the way she was dressed. 4So I bowed down to her and said,<br />
        “I am going to your house.”<br />
        She said,<br />
        “What will you give me?”<br />
        I gave her my staff, my belt, and the royal crown. I went to her, and she became pregnant. 5I wanted to kill her, not knowing what she had done. But she secretly sent me the garments and made me feel ashamed. 6I called her and heard the secret words I had spoken while I was sleeping with her in my drunkenness. I could not kill her, for the thing was from God. 7 I said to myself, “Has she acted deceitfully after receiving the pledge from another?” 8 But I did not go near her until the days of my death, for she had committed this wicked act throughout all Israel. 9 The people of the city said that there was no prostitute at the gate; that she had come from another country and had sat there for a short time. 10 I thought that no one had known that I had gone to her house. 11 After this we went to Egypt with Joseph because of the famine. 12 I was forty-six years old at the time, and I lived there seventy-three years.<br />
        13 “My sons, listen to what your father commands you. Keep all my words, so that you may keep the commandments of the Lord and obey the commandments of the Lord God. 2 Do not walk in the way of your own desires or the thoughts of your minds in the pride of your hearts. Do not boast about the strength of your youth, for that too is evil in the sight of the Lord. 3 I boasted that during my wars no beautiful woman's face had deceived me, and I had heaped reproach on Reuben because of Bala, my father's wife. But the spirits of envy and fornication were arrayed against me until I fell before Beshua the Canaanite and Tamar, my sons' wife. 4 I said to my father-in-law, "I will take counsel with my father and take your daughter." But he refused. He showed me a great amount of gold that was at his daughter's disposal, since he was king. 5 He adorned her with gold and pearls and made her, in all her beauty, pour out for us at the banquet. 6 Wine made my eyes wander, and pleasure blinded my heart. 7I fell in love with her and transgressed the commandment of the Lord and my parents by taking her as my wife. 8But the Lord rewarded me according to the desires of my heart, because I had no joy in her children.<br />
        14 My children, do not get drunk with wine, for it turns the mind away from the truth, stirs it up to lust, and leads the eyes to destruction. 2 For the spirit of fornication uses wine as its servant to give pleasure to the senses; both of these also rob a man of strength. 3 If a man drinks wine to the point of getting drunk, he stirs up his mind to fornication through unclean thoughts and heats his body for sexual intercourse. And if the cause of lust is present, he commits sin without shame. 4 So is wine, my children, for a drunkard is not ashamed before anyone. 5 But it led me astray so that I would not feel shame before the crowd of citizens; in the sight of all I bowed down to Tamar. I committed a great sin and lifted the veil of impurity from my children. 6Because of wine I did not respect the commandment of God and married a Canaanite woman. 7Therefore, my children, he who drinks wine needs understanding. This is the wisdom of drinking: to drink only while maintaining decency. 8But if this boundary is crossed, it breaks into the mind and stirs up the spirit of error and makes the drunkard speak what is unseemly, transgress the law without feeling shame, even to the point of glorying in dishonor as something beautiful.<br />
        15 A fornicator does not feel that he is hurt or ashamed when he loses his honor. 2A fornicator, even if he is a king, is stripped of royalty, for he becomes a slave to fornication, just as I was. 3I gave up my staff, that is, the support of my tribe, my belt, that is, my power, and the diadem, that is, the honor of my kingdom. 4Then I repented of this and did not enjoy wine or meat until my old age, nor did I enjoy any kind of joy. 5The angel of the Lord showed me that women always rule over both the king and the beggar. 6They rob the king of his honor, the brave of his strength, and the needy of even the smallest sustenance of his poverty.<br />
        16So, my sons, keep your distance from wine, for there are four evil spirits in it: lust, ardor, debauchery, and unclean lucre. 2If you drink wine in moments of joy, do so with the fear of God and with self-control. If you do not drink with this mind and the fear of God departs from you, then drunkenness will set in, and with it shamelessness will come. 3If you do not (keep your composure), do not drink at all, so that you may not sin by abusive words, by quarreling, by slander, and by transgressing the commandments of God, and perish before your time. 4Wine reveals to strangers the secrets of God and of men, just as I revealed the commandments of God and the secrets of my father Jacob to Besue the Canaanite woman, whom God commanded not to reveal them. Wine is a cause of strife and unrest.<br />
        17 “I command you, my sons, not to set your love on money, nor to look at the beauty of women, for for money and beauty I went astray with Besue the Canaanite. 2 For I know that because of these two things you, my descendants, will fall into evil. 3 For I know that these two things will ruin the wise men among my sons and will cause the kingdom of Judah to fall, which the Lord gave me because of my obedience to my father. 4 For I did not grieve my father Jacob, for I did everything he commanded me. 5 Abraham, my father's father, blessed me to reign over Israel, and Isaac blessed me. 6 For I know that kingship will be established from me.<br />
        18 I have also read in the books of Enoch the righteous what evil things you will commit in the last days.<br />
        2 Therefore, my children, beware of fornication and the love of money;<br />
        listen to Jacob your father,<br />
        3 for such things turn you away from the law of God<br />
        and blind the deliberations of the mind.<br />
        They instill pride<br />
        and do not allow a man to have mercy on his neighbor.<br />
        4 They deprive the soul of all goodness<br />
        and force it to work and labor;<br />
        they rob it of sleep<br />
        and consume its flesh.<br />
        5 They hinder sacrifices to God,<br />
        do not remember his praise,<br />
        do not obey the words of the prophets<br />
        , and hate godly speech.<br />
        6 Serving two passions contrary to the commandments of God, a man cannot obey the divinity; they blind his soul and he walks by day as if it were night.<br />
        19 My children, the love of money leads to idols; deceived by it, they believe in gods that are not. Greed leads the one who has it to madness. 2 For the sake of money I lost my children, and I would have died without any had it not been for the penitence of my flesh, the humility of my soul, and the prayers of Jacob my father. 3 But the God of my fathers, compassionate and merciful, forgave me because I acted in ignorance. 4 The prince of error blinded me, and I did not consider how man and flesh are corrupted by sin. But I learned my weakness when I thought I was invincible.<br />
        20 Therefore, my children, there are two spirits in man: the spirit of truth and the spirit of error. 2 Between them is the spirit of understanding, which inclines wherever it wants. 3 The works of truth and those of error are written on the breast of a man, and the Lord knows each one of them. 4 There is no time when the works of men can go unnoticed, for they are written before the Lord on the breast, in the bones of the man. 5 The spirit of truth bears witness to all that is good and accuses all that is evil. The sinner is enveloped in the fire of his own heart and cannot lift up his face to the Judge.<br />
        21 Now, my children, love Levi, so that you may stand; do not rise up against him, so that you may not perish. 2 To me the Lord gave the kingdom, but to him the priesthood, subordinating the former to the latter. 3He gave me the earthly things, and he gave him the heavenly things. 4As heaven is greater than earth, so the priesthood of God is greater than earthly kingship, if the former does not turn away from the Lord through sin and is not overpowered by earthly kingship. 5He, not you, has the Lord chosen to come to him, to eat of his table and of his firstfruits, the delights of the children of Israel. 6You will reign in Jacob and be to them like the sea. Just as the righteous and the unrighteous are driven to and fro in the deep, some going captive and some getting rich, so there will be in you all kinds of people: some will suffer trouble and be taken prisoner, some will get rich by plunder.<br />
        7Kings will be like great whales,<br />
        swallowing people like fish.<br />
        They will enslave the free, both men and women,<br />
        and they will plunder houses, fields, flocks and wealth.<br />
        8They will wickedly fill the ravens and ibis with the flesh of many.<br />
        They will go forth in wickedness,<br />
        taking pride in their greed.<br />
        9They will be false prophets, like hurricanes,<br />
        and will pursue all the righteous.<br />
        22 -1The Lord will bring divisions among them, and there will be continual fighting in Israel. 2My kingdom will end among foreign nations, until the salvation of Israel comes, [until the coming of the righteous God], so that Jacob [and all peoples] may rest in peace. 3He will keep the strength of my kingdom forever, for the Lord solemnly swore to me that the kingship of my descendants would continue at all times, forever.<br />
        23 -1I am very sorry, my sons, for the immorality, magic and idolatrous acts that you will perform against the kingdom, following the steps of diviners, demons and false omens. 2You will make your daughters dancers and courtesans and you will mingle with the abominations of the Gentiles. 3Therefore the Lord will bring upon you famine and pestilence, death and avenging sword, siege of cities, dogs that tear the flesh of his enemies, insults from friends, destruction and inflammation of eyes, annihilation of children, abduction of wives, plundering of your property, burning of the temple of God, desolation of your land and captivity among the Gentiles. 4From among you they will castrate eunuchs for their wives. 5But when you return to the Lord with a perfect heart, repenting and walking according to all the commandments of God, the Lord will visit you with mercy and bring you out from the bondage of your enemies.<br />
        24 - 1After this a star will arise in peace from the offspring of Jacob [and a man will arise from my seed like a righteous sun, walking with the sons of men in humility and justice, and no sin will be found in him. 2The heavens will open above him to pour out the blessings of the Spirit of the Holy Father. He himself will also pour out the spirit of grace on you. 3You will be his children in truth and walk in the path of his precepts, the first and the last. 4This is the shoot of the Most High God and the very source of life for every human being]. 5Then the scepter of my kingdom will shine, and a shoot will grow from your roots. 6In him will arise a righteous staff for the Gentiles, to execute justice and to save all who call on the Lord.<br />
        25 Then Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob will come to life, and I and my brothers will be heads of our tribes in Israel: Levi the first, I the second, Joseph the third, Benjamin the fourth, Simeon the fifth, Issachar the sixth, and so on, all. 2The Lord will bless Levi; the angel of the presence will bless me; the glorious powers will bless Simeon; the heavens will bless Reuben; the earth will bless Issachar; the sea will bless Zebulun; the mountains will bless Joseph; the tabernacle will bless Benjamin; the lights of heaven will bless Dan; the delights will bless Naphtali; the sun will bless Gad; the olive trees will bless Asher.<br />
        3There will be one people of the Lord and one language,<br />
        The deceitful spirit of Beliar will no longer exist,<br />
        for it will be thrown into the fire forever and ever.<br />
        4Those who died in sorrow will rise in joy,<br />
        and those who lived in poverty for the Lord will be rich;<br />
        the needy will be satisfied,<br />
        the weak will be strengthened,<br />
        and those who were slain for the Lord will be awakened to life.<br />
        5The deer of Jacob will run for joy,<br />
        and the eagles of Israel will fly with gladness;<br />
        [The wicked will mourn, the sinners will groan],<br />
        and all the peoples will praise the Lord forever.<br />
        26 - 1Keep therefore, my sons, the whole law of the Lord, for there is hope for all who make their ways right. 2 He said to them,<br />
        "Today I am dying before your eyes at the age of one hundred and nineteen. 3 Do not bury me in fine clothing or open my belly, for such things do kings, but take me with you to Hebron."<br />
        4 After he had said these words, Judah fell asleep. His sons did as he had commanded them and buried him in Hebron with his fathers.</p>
        
        <p>Appendix<br />
        Midras Wayyisau</p>
        
        <p>About this midrash, the part corresponding to Jub 37,14.17; 38,2-3.5-10.12-15 is edited. Here we translate from Hebrew the fragment of this composition in which the TestJud is paraphrased. The base text is that of R.H. Charles, more elaborate than the one presented by Jellinek in his Beth-ha-Midrash III, 1-3. The numbers in parentheses, the corresponding passages of the TestJud.<br />
        <br />
        "They set out, and the terror of God fell . . . " (Gen 35,5). They said: Two sons of Jacob carried out this great action . . . if they were all together they could destroy the world. The fear of God (Holy, blessed be He) fell upon them, so they did not pursue the sons of Jacob. Our teachers said: Although they did not go after them this time, shortly afterward two of those pursued them. The kings of the Amorites conspired against the sons of Jacob and tried to destroy them in the valley of Shechem.<br />
        After this, Jacob and his sons returned to Shechem and lived there. Some of them said, "It was not enough that they killed all the men of Shechem; they also took their country."<br />
        They all gathered together and came against them to kill them. When Judah saw this, he jumped into the midst of the enemy's ranks and killed first Yashub king of Tappuah, who was covered from head to foot in iron and copper, riding on a horse, and he threw javelins from front to back with both hands. He never missed where he threw them, for he was a mighty warrior, throwing with both hands (3:2-3).<br />
        When Judah saw this, he was not afraid of him or his arrogance. He jumped up and ran to meet him. He took a stone from the ground, weighing sixty sela'im, and threw it at him when he was two-thirds of a stadia's distance away, which is 173 cubits. He was coming towards Judah, adorned with all his iron trappings and throwing javelins. Judah struck him with the stone on his shield and knocked him off his horse. He tried to get up immediately, but Judah ran and tried to kill him before he could get up from the ground. But he quickly got up before Judah and prepared to fight him, shield against shield. He raised his sword and tried to cut off Judah's head. Judah raised his shield before the sword and parried the blow with it, which split into two (3,4).<br />
        What did Judah do? He turned around and struck him with his sword, cutting off his feet above the ankles. Then he fell to the ground, and the sword from his hand. Judah leaped towards him and cut off his head. But as he was stripping him of his armor, nine of his companions came against him. Judah threw a stone at the first who came near, hitting him on the head and knocking his shield out of his hand. Judah took it and continued to confront the other eight (3,5).<br />
        Levi his brother came and stood by him; he shot his arrows and killed Ailon king of Gaish (Gen 26:34; Jos 24:30). Judah killed the remaining eight. Jacob his father came and killed Zerurah king of Shiloh, but none of them rose up against the sons of Jacob, for they had no heart to resist, but to flee.<br />
        Jacob's sons pursued them, and Judah killed a thousand that day before the sun set. The rest of Jacob's sons set out from Tel Shechem, from the place where they had been resisting, and they pursued them with all haste until they came out to the plain of the city. And there they engaged in a fiercer battle than any they had engaged in in the valley of Shechem (4:1).<br />
        Jacob shot his arrows and killed Pharaoh king of Hazor; 1 Maccabees, 1 Maccabees, 2 Maccabees, 3 Maccabees, 4 Maccabees, 5 Maccabees, 6 Maccabees, 7 Maccabees, 8 Maccabees, 9 Maccabees, 10 Maccabees, 11 Maccabees, 12 Maccabees, 13 Maccabees, 14 Maccabees, 15 Maccabees, 16 Maccabees, 17 Maccabees, 18 Maccabees, 19 Maccabees, 20 Maccabees, 21 Maccabees, 22 Maccabees, 23 Maccabees, 24 Maccabees,<br />
        25 Maccabees, 26 Maccabees, 27 Maccabees, 28 Maccabees, 29 Maccabees, 30 Maccabees, 31 Maccabees, 32 Maccabees, 33 Maccabees, 34 Maccabees, 35 Maccabees, 36 Maccabees, 37 Maccabees, 38 Maccabees, 39 Maccabees, 40 Maccabees, 41 Maccabees, 42 Maccabees, 43 Maccabees, 44 Maccabees, 45 Maccabees, 46 Maccabees, 47 Maccabees, 48 ​​Maccabees, 49 Maccabees, 50 Maccabees, 51 Maccabees, 52 Maccabees, 53 Maccabees, 54 Maccabees, 55 Maccabees, 56 Maccabees, 57 Maccabees, 58 Maccabees, 59 Maccabees, 60 Maccabees, 61 Maccabees, 62 Maccabees, 63 Maccabees, 64 Maccabees,<br />
        On the second day they went against Zartan and fought there too, for it was a walled city and secure in its strength, attacking anyone who approached it. There was no room to approach the wall because it was strong and high, and there was no place to capture it (5:1).<br />
        That day they captured the city. They went up to the wall: Judah first from the east, Gad from the west, Simeon and Levi from the north, and Reuben and Dan from the south. Issachar and Naphtali came up and burned the piers of the city gates. The fighting was fierce on the wall until the troops of their allies came up there. They resisted them in the tower until Judah captured it. Then he went up to the top of the tower and killed two hundred men on its roof before coming down from it (5:2-5).<br />
        All the men of the city united and killed the foreigners. They did not spare any of them, for they were strong men and brave enough for war. They took the prisoners from there and retreated after them to Tappuah. When the men of Tappuah came out to rescue the prisoners from their hands, whom they had captured on the plain of the city, they went to Arbael and killed the men who had come out to rescue the prisoners (5:6-7).<br />
        On the third day they went to Tappuah in the morning, and as they were gathering the prisoners, the people of Shiloh came to fight. They put on their armor and went after them, killing them all before noon. They entered Shiloh after the women, giving them no chance to resist. That day they captured the city and brought out the prisoners. The band of their allies they had left at Tappuah came and plundered the city with them (6:1-3).<br />
        On the fourth day they crossed before the camps of Sebir. Then they went out to free the prisoners and went down to the middle of the valley. They (the sons of Jacob) prepared themselves, went up after them, and killed them before they reached the height. That day the men of the camp of Sebir came out before them and threw stones at them. During the day the sons of Jacob captured and killed all the warriors. They freed all the prisoners and gathered them together with those who were already with them (6:3-5).<br />
        On the fifth day they went to Goash, for they heard that a great multitude of Amorites had gathered there and said that they were coming against them. But Goash was a fortified city, one of the cities of the kings of the Amorites. They went there and engaged in battle with the city until noon and were unable to capture it because it had three walls, one behind the other. They prepared to besiege it while they were insulting them. At that moment Judah's anger overflowed, and a spirit of vengeance entered into him and shook him with all its power. He was the first to climb the wall and Judah was about to die. Had his father Jacob not been there, he would have died there, had he not drawn his bow and killed right and left (7:1-3).<br />
        On his right were some throwing stones at him, and on his left and in front were others ready to fight, They were all trying to beat him down from the wall, but Dan his brother came up and drove them back. Naphtali was third behind them, and Simeon and Levi pressed on and came up in the evening. The five of them resisted and gave them no chance to resist, killing a great many of them, and so they continued until a river of blood had formed.<br />
        That day they captured the city at sunset and killed all the warriors. They brought out the prisoners and went outside the city to rest, for they were tired (7:4-7).<br />
        On the sixth day all the Amorites gathered together and came by themselves without war gear, bowed down to them, and asked for peace. They did so, and Timnah and all the land around it were restored to them. Then Jacob made peace with them, and they restored to Jacob's sons all the livestock they had seized, two for one; they imposed a tribute on them and returned the prisoners to them. Jacob withdrew to Timnah (read: 'and Jacob built Timnah, with CrYer and TestJud) and Judah to Arbael. From then on they remained at peace with the Amorites (7,8-11).<br />

        <h2 dir="ltr" >ISSACHAR'S TESTAMENT</h2>
        
        <h3 dir="ltr" >On simplicity</h3>
        
        <p>1 -1A copy of the words of Issachar. He called his sons together and said to them,<br />
        “Listen, children, to Issachar your father; give ear to the words of the one whom the Lord loves. 2I was born the fifth son of Jacob, as a reward for mandrakes. 3Reuben brought mandrakes from the field, but Rachel met him and took them from him. 4Reuben was weeping because of this, and Leah my mother came out with her cries. 5These mandrakes were apples of a sweet aroma, produced in the land of Aran, high above, under a steep waterfall.<br />
        6Rachel said,<br />
        “I will not give them back to you; they will be mine instead of children.”<br />
        7There were two apples. Leah said,<br />
        “It should be enough for you that you have taken the man of my virginity from me. Will you take these too?”<br />
        8She said,<br />
        “Jacob may spend the night with you in your son’s mandrakes.”<br />
        9Leah said to her,<br />
        “Do not boast or boast. Jacob is mine; I am the wife of his youth.”<br />
        10Rachel said,<br />
        “What? He was betrothed to me first, and for my sake he served my father fourteen years. 11What shall I do with you, since the deceitfulness and schemes of men have increased, and misfortune is on the land? Otherwise you would not have seen Jacob’s face. 12For you are not his wife, but you were brought in by deceit instead of me. 13My father deceived me and took me to another place that night, not allowing me to see anything. If I had been there, this would not have happened.”<br />
        14Rachel said,<br />
        “Take one mandrake, and with the other I will leave Jacob with you for one night.”<br />
        15Jacob knew Leah, and she became pregnant and bore me. For this wages I was called Issachar.<br />
        2 Then an angel of the Lord appeared to Jacob and said,<br />
        “Rachel will bear two sons, because she despised marriage with a man and chose self-control.<br />
        2 If my mother Leah had not exchanged the two apples for marriage with Jacob, she would have borne eight sons. But she bore six, and Rachel two. The Lord visited her because of the mandrakes, 3 for he saw that she desired to be with Jacob for children, not for pleasure. 4 The next day she gave Jacob up again in order to receive the other mandrake. So by the mandrakes God made Rachel conceive. 5 For she craved them and did not eat them, but offered them to the Lord in his temple, presenting them to the priest of the Most High who officiated at that time.<br />
        3 When I grew up, I walked with an upright heart. I became a farmer on the land of my fathers and brothers, and I brought them the produce of the field at every season. 2 My father blessed me because he saw that I lived in simplicity. 3 I was not nosy, nor malicious, nor malicious toward my neighbor. 4 I did not speak ill of anyone or criticize anyone's life, but lived with simple eyes. 5 Therefore I married a wife when I was thirty years old, because work consumed my energy. My mind was not set on the pleasure that women provide, but because of work I was overcome by sleep. 6 My father always rejoiced because of my simplicity. If I gained anything from my work, I would offer the produce and the firstfruits to the Lord through the priest, then to my father, and I came third. 7 The Lord doubled the goods through my hands, and Jacob knew that God cooperated with my simplicity. 8He provided the poor and afflicted with the good things of the earth in a sincere heart.<br />
        4 Listen to me now, my children, and act with sincerity of heart, for I know that in this is the Lord's good pleasure.<br />
        2 The simple man does not long for gold,<br />
        does not abuse his neighbor,<br />
        does not crave various delicacies,<br />
        does not like fancy clothing,<br />
        3 nor does he desire long life for himself,<br />
        but waits only for the will of God.<br />
        4 The spirits of error can do nothing against him,<br />
        for he does not seek to delight in womanly beauty ,<br />
        so as not to stain his mind with madness.<br />
        5 Envy does not enter into his deliberations,<br />
        nor does malice take hold of his soul,<br />
        nor does he continually think of abundance with insatiable desire.<br />
        6He acts with an upright soul,<br />
        and looks at everything with a simple heart,<br />
        not accepting the evils of worldly error in his eyes<br />
        so as not to see the commandments of the Lord in a twisted way.<br />
        5 -1Keep the law of God, my children, and be sincere. Walk without malice, not inquiring into the commandments of God or the deeds of your neighbor. 2But love the Lord and your neighbor, and have compassion on the poor and the weak. 3Turn your backs to agriculture and work hard at the work of the land, in every kind of work, presenting your gifts to the Lord with joy. 4For the Lord has blessed you with the firstfruits of the earth, just as he blessed all the saints from Abel until now. 5For you have not been given any inheritance except the fatness of the earth, whose fruit is born of labor. 6My father Jacob blessed me with the blessing of the land and with the firstfruits of its crops. 7Levi and Judah have received glory from the Lord among the sons of Jacob, for he has divided their inheritance: to one the priesthood, to the other the kingdom. 8So obey them and walk in the simplicity of your father... [for it has been granted to Gad to annihilate the pirate hordes that harass Israel].<br />
        6 -1I know, my sons, that in the last days your sons will abandon simplicity and will join insatiable desires. Abandoning innocence they will draw near to wickedness, and forgetting the precepts of the Lord they will become disciples of Beliar. 2They will abandon agriculture and follow the evil intentions of their thoughts. They will be scattered among the nations and serve their enemies. 3Tell your sons these things so that, if they sin, they will quickly return to the Lord. 4For he is merciful and will have mercy on them and bring them back to their homeland.<br />
        7 I am now one hundred and twenty-two years old, and I do not know that there has been any mortal sin in me.<br />
        2 I have not known any woman except my own,<br />
        nor have I committed fornication with my eyes lifted up.<br />
        3 I have not drunk wine to the point of madness,<br />
        nor have I coveted my neighbor's desirable goods.<br />
        4 Deceit has not settled in my heart,<br />
        nor has lying come to my lips.<br />
        5 I have joined my groans to the groans of the afflicted,<br />
        and I have given part of my bread to the poor.<br />
        I have not eaten alone;<br />
        I have not removed the boundary stones.<br />
        All my days I have been devout and have spoken the truth.<br />
        6 I have loved the Lord with all my might,<br />
        and I have loved men as well as my children.<br />
        7 Do likewise, my children,<br />
        and the spirit of Beliar will flee from you,<br />
        and no evil deed will have dominion over you.<br />
        You will dominate the wild beasts,<br />
        having with you the God of heaven<br />
        [who walks with men of simple heart].<br />
        8He ordered them to bring him up to Hebron and bury him there in the cave with his fathers. 9He spread out his feet and died, the fifth (of Jacob's sons), in a good old age, full of vigor and with all his limbs healthy. And he fell into eternal sleep.<br />

        <h2 dir="ltr" >TESTAMENT OF ZEBULON</h2>
        
        <h3 dir="ltr" >On compassion and mercy</h3>
        
        <p>1 -1Copy (of the words) of Zebulun, from the will that he gave to his sons at the age of one hundred and fourteen, two years after the death of Joseph. 2He said to them:<br />
        -Listen to me, sons of Zebulun; pay attention to the word of your father. 3I am Zebulun, a good gift to my parents. When I was born, our father became very rich in flocks of sheep and oxen, since he obtained his portion by the two-colored sticks. 4I am not aware, my sons, of any sin during my life, except in thought. 5I do not remember any transgression of the law, except the sin of ignorance committed against Joseph, because I determined with my brothers not to tell my father anything about what had happened. 6I wept much in secret, for I feared my brothers, since they had all agreed that, if anyone revealed the secret, he would be put to the sword. 7But when they were about to destroy Joseph, I exhorted them with many tears not to do such wicked things.<br />
        2 Now Simeon and Gad came, angry with Joseph, ready to destroy him. Joseph fell on his knees and said to them,<br />
        2“Have pity on me, my brothers, and have pity on the bowels of our father Jacob. Do not lay your hands on me to shed innocent blood, for I have not sinned against you. 3And if I have, punish me, but do not lift up your hands for the sake of our father Jacob.”<br />
        4When he had spoken these words in his distress, I was moved with compassion and wept. My heart melted within me, and all my bowels melted within me. 5Joseph wept, and I wept with him; my heart was pounding, my joints were loose, and I could not stand. 6When Joseph saw that I was weeping with him and that the others were rushing to kill him, he hid behind me and pleaded with them. 7Reuben said to them,<br />
        “Brothers, let us not kill him, but throw him into one of the dry cisterns our fathers dug, in which they found no water.” 8For this was the reason the Lord had kept the water from coming up in them, so that Joseph could be saved. 9So the Lord did so until they sold Joseph to the Ishmaelites.<br />
        3 “My sons, I had no part in the sale price of Joseph. 2But Simeon, Gad, and the other six of our brothers took the money from Joseph’s sale and bought sandals for themselves and their wives and children. They said,<br />
        3 “We will not buy food with him, since it is the price of our brother’s blood, but we will trample him underfoot, because he said he would reign over us.” So we'll see where his dreams come from.<br />
        4For this reason it is written in the Book of the Law of Moses: “If anyone does not want to have children for his brother, untie his sandals and spit in his face.” 5 Joseph’s brothers did not want him to live, so the Lord untied the sandals they had put on against Joseph, their brother. 6When they came to Egypt, Joseph’s servants untied their sandals at the gate of the city, and they knelt before their brother, as before Pharaoh. 7Not only did they kneel, but they were covered with spittle immediately, even kneeling before him. And so they were astonished before the Egyptians, 8for they heard about all the evil they had done to Joseph.<br />
        4After they threw him into the cistern, they ate. 2I did not eat for two days and nights, because I was filled with grief for Joseph. Judah did not eat with them, but kept watch at the well, for fear that Simeon and Gad would come and kill him. 3When they saw that I was not eating, they made me keep watch until they were sold. 4Joseph stayed in the pit for three days and nights, and they sold him hungry. 5When Reuben heard that Joseph had been sold in his absence, he tore his clothes and lamented,<br />
        “How can I look upon the face of my father Jacob?”<br />
        6He took the money and ran after the merchants, but he found no one, for they had left the main road and taken a shortcut through the country of the troglodytes. 7Reuben did not eat that day. Then Dan came to him and said,<br />
        8“Do not weep or mourn, for I have thought of what we will tell our father.” 9Let us sacrifice a young goat and put its blood on Joseph's robe and say, "See if this is your son's robe."<br />
        So they did. 10For when they were about to sell Joseph, they stripped him of our father's robe and put an old one from a slave on him. 11Simeon had the robe, and he would not give it to us, for he was eager to tear it with his sword, because Joseph, whom he had not been able to kill, was still alive. 12We all rose up against him and said to him,<br />
        "If you do not give it to us, we will say that you alone have done this wickedness in Israel.<br />
        " 13So he gave it to him, and they did just as Dan had said.<br />
        5 Now I urge you, my sons, to keep the commandments of the Lord, to be merciful to your neighbors, and to show compassion toward all, not only to human beings but also to the unreasonable. 2 For this reason the Lord has blessed me, and while all my brothers have suffered from illness, I have gone through life without illness, for the Lord knows the purpose of each one. 3 Be merciful, my sons, for as you deal with your neighbors, so will the Lord deal with you. 4 Therefore the sons of my brothers became sick and died because of Joseph, because they had no mercy in their hearts. But my sons, on the other hand, remained without illness, as you know. 5 When I was in Canaan on the coast, I fished for my father Jacob. Many were drowned in the sea, but I was not harmed.<br />
        6 I was the first to build a boat to sail on the sea, for the Lord had given me understanding and wisdom to do so. 2 I put a log in the stern and set up a sail on a straight log in the middle of the boat. 3 I sailed along the coast and fished for my father's household until we came to Egypt. 4 I was full of compassion and shared my catch with all the strangers. 5 If I found anyone or anyone who was sick or old, I would boil the fish and prepare them well and give to each person according to his need, gathering them and sharing their afflictions. 6 Therefore the Lord gave me a great catch, for the one who shares with his neighbor receives much more from the Lord. 7 I was a fisherman for five years, sharing my share with everyone and providing for all the needs of my father's household. 8 In the summer I fished, and in the winter I tended the flocks with my brothers.<br />
        7 Now I will tell you what I did. I saw a man suffering from nakedness in the winter. Out of pity for him, I stole a cloak from my house and gave it secretly to the man who was cold. 2 My children, out of whatever the Lord provides for you, have pity on everyone, showing mercy without discrimination, and help the needy of every person with kindness of heart. 3 And if at any time you are unable to give to someone in need, have compassion on him with a bowel of mercy. 4 If at any time my hand did not find something to give to the needy, I would accompany him seven stadia, weeping with him, and my bowels would turn to him in compassion.<br />
        8 My children, have compassion on every person in mercy, so that the Lord will have compassion on you. 2 For in the last days the Lord will send his mercy on the earth and will dwell where he finds compassion. 3 As long as a person has compassion on his neighbor, so will the Lord have compassion. 4 For when we went down to Egypt, Joseph did not harm us, but had compassion on me. 5 Remembering his behavior, do not resent him, my children, but love one another and do not examine your brother's sin. 6 This breaks up the unity and destroys all family feelings, disturbs the soul and destroys life, for the resentful have no compassion.<br />
        9 Consider the waters: when they flow in the same channel, they carry stones, logs, earth and sand. 2But if it is divided into multiple streams, the earth absorbs it and nothing happens. 3If you separate, the same will happen to you. 4Do not be divided into two heads, because everything the Lord made has one [head]. He gave us two shoulders, two hands, two feet, but all the members obey one head. 5I have read in the writings of my fathers that in the last days you will turn away from the Lord, there will be divisions in Israel, you will follow two different kings, you will commit all kinds of abominations and worship all kinds of idols. 6Your enemies will enslave you and you will live among the Gentiles with all kinds of diseases, tribulations and pains of soul. 7But afterward you will remember the Lord and repent, and he will return you to your land, because he is merciful and full of mercy; he does not take into account the evil of humans, since they are flesh, and the spirit of error deceives them in all their actions. 8Then the Lord himself will arise over you as a light of justice, carrying healing and mercy on his wings. He will rescue the sons of men from the captivity of Beliar, and all the spirits of error will be trampled underfoot. He will turn all peoples to zeal for his sake, and you will see God [in the form of a man] (in the temple) whom the Lord will choose: Jerusalem is his name. 9You will again provoke him to anger with your evil deeds and you will be rejected until the time of consummation.<br />
        10 Now, my sons, do not grieve over my death or be dismayed at my departure, 2 for I will arise among you as a leader among your children. I will rejoice among my tribe, among all who kept the law of the Lord and the precepts of Zebulun their father. 3But on the wicked God will fall eternal fire and destroy them forever. 4Now I am running to my rest, like my fathers. 5Fear the Lord your God with all your strength all the days of your life.<br />
        6When he had said these words, he fell asleep in a sweet sleep, and his sons laid him on a bier. 7Then they took him up to Hebron and buried him with his fathers.<br />

        <h2 dir="ltr" >TESTAMENT OF DAN</h2>
        
        <h3 dir="ltr" >On anger and lies</h3>
        
        <p>1 -1This is a copy of the words that Dan spoke to his sons in the last days, when he was one hundred and twenty-five years old. 2He called his family together and said to them:<br />
        “Listen, you sons of Dan, to my speech; pay attention to the words from your father's mouth. 3I have the proof, in my heart and in my life, that truth combined with good deeds is beautiful and pleasing to God; but lying and anger are evil, because they teach man all kinds of evil. 4I confess to you today, my sons, that I rejoiced in my heart at the death of Joseph, a good and true man. 5I rejoiced at the sale of Joseph, because my father loved him more than us. 6The spirit of envy and pride said to me, “You are also his son.” 7One of the spirits of Beliar worked with me and said to me, “Take this sword and kill Joseph with it; your father will love you after he is dead.” 8This was the spirit of wrath that tried to persuade me to tear Joseph apart as a panther devours a fawn. 9But the God of Jacob our father did not put him into my hands when he was alone or allow me to commit the wickedness of destroying two tribes in Israel.<br />
        2 Now, my sons, I am dying. I tell you truly, unless you guard yourselves against the spirits of deceit and wrath, unless you love truth and kindness, you will perish. 2 Blindness dwells in wrath, my sons, and no one can see another person truthfully. 3 Even if it is father or mother, he regards them as enemies, and even if it is a brother, he does not regard them. If it is a prophet of the Lord, he does not listen to them. If it is a righteous man, he does not look at them, and if it is a friend, he does not acknowledge them. 4The spirit of anger envelops him in the nets of deceit, blinds his eyes, fills his mind with darkness through lies, and presents him with its own vision. With what does it surround his eyes? With hatred of the heart, so that he takes an envious stance against his brother.<br />
        3 -1Anger is evil, my children; it is like a soul in the soul itself. 2It takes possession of the body of the angry man, dominates his soul, and gives the body a peculiar energy to commit all kinds of impieties. 3And when the soul has acted, it justifies what it has done, since it no longer sees. 4For this reason, the angry man, if he is a strong man, has a triple energy through anger: the first, through the strength and collaboration of those under him; the second, through wealth, for he exercises persuasion by force, thereby winning unjustly; the third, through the natural energy of the body, through which he works evil. 5But if the wrathful man is weak, he has twice as much strength as natural strength, for anger helps him in all his wicked deeds. 6This spirit, along with the spirit of lies, always walks at the right hand of Satan, and his actions are cruel and deceitful.<br />
        4 Now realize that the power of anger is a vain thing. 2 First it excites with words, then it strengthens the angry man with its actions, and disturbs his mind with bitter losses, and so it excites the soul with great rage. 3 When someone speaks against you, do not be moved to anger, and if someone praises you as good, do not be proud and change your mind to like or dislike. 4 First, anger flatters the ear, and so spurs the mind to consider the object that excites it. Then, when it is angry, it thinks that it has been angered with reason. 5 If you suffer some injury or loss, my children, do not be disturbed, for this same spirit causes one to desire what is lost in order to make it angry by desire. 6 If you suffer injury voluntarily or involuntarily, do not be sad, for from sadness anger is aroused along with lying. 7Anger and deceit are a double evil, and both work together to disturb the reason. And when the soul is continually troubled, the Lord turns away from it and Beliar takes over.<br />
        5 Therefore, my sons, keep the commandments of the Lord and observe his law.<br />
        Turn away from anger and hate lying,<br />
        so that the Lord may dwell in you and Beliar may flee.<br />
        2 Let each one speak truth to his neighbor;<br />
        then you will not fall into anger and confusion,<br />
        but you will remain in peace in the possession of the Lord of peace<br />
        and no conflict will take hold of you.<br />
        3 Love the Lord all your days,<br />
        and love one another with a true heart.<br />
        4 I know that in the last days you will turn away from the Lord,<br />
        that you will provoke Levi and oppose Judah,<br />
        but you will not prevail against them,<br />
        for the angel of the Lord will lead them,<br />
        for Israel will remain in them.<br />
        5When you turn away from the Lord, you will commit all kinds of wickedness, committing the wickedness of the Gentiles, committing fornication with the wives of the wicked in all kinds of perversions, driven within you by the spirits of deceit. 6I have read in the book of Enoch the righteous that Satan is your chief, and that all the spirits of fornication and pride will rise up against Levi to lay ambushes for his sons and make them sin before the Lord. 7My sons will draw near to Levi to sin with them in every way. The sons of Judah will be greedy, snatching away what is not theirs like lions. 8For this reason you will be led with them into captivity, and there all the plagues of Egypt will come upon you, and all the evils of the Gentiles. 9But then you will return to the Lord and obtain mercy; he will lead you to his sanctuary, invoking peace upon you. 10He will raise up for you from the tribes of Judah and Levi the salvation of the Lord.<br />
        He will make war on Beliar<br />
        and take victorious vengeance on our enemies.<br />
        11He will snatch the captives—the souls of the saints—from Beliar,<br />
        turn the disobedient hearts to the Lord,<br />
        and grant those who call on him everlasting peace.<br />
        12The saints will rest in Eden,<br />
        and the righteous will rejoice in the new Jerusalem,<br />
        which will stand to the glory of God forever.<br />
        13Jerusalem will never again be desolate,<br />
        nor will Israel be held in bondage,<br />
        for the Lord will be in her midst,<br />
        the<br />
        Holy One of Israel, reigning over them<br />
        .<br />
        6My children, fear the Lord and guard yourselves against Satan and his spirits. 2Draw near to God and to the angel who intercedes for you, for he is the mediator between God and men for the peace of Israel and will oppose the kingdom of the enemy. 3Therefore the adversary will be quick to bring down all who call on the Lord. 4For he knows that on the day Israel creates, the kingdom of the enemy will end. 5The angel of peace will strengthen Israel so that it will not rush into the height of evil. 6[In the time of Israel's wickedness, the Lord will turn away from it and go to the Gentiles who will do his will,] for none of the angels is like him. 7His name will be found in every place in Israel [and among the Gentiles] as a savior. 8Beware, therefore, my children, of every evil deed, cast away from yourselves all wrath and falsehood; but love truth and kindness. 9The words that you have heard from the mouth of your father, pass on to your children [so that the Savior of the Gentiles may receive you. He is a friend of truth and kind, meek and humble, and teaches the law of God by his works]. 10So turn away from all wickedness and hold fast to the righteousness of the law of the Lord, so that my offspring may be saved forever. 11Bury me with my fathers.”<br />
        7 After saying these words, he kissed them and sent them to eternal sleep. 2His sons buried him, but they carried his bones with the bones of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. 3And just as Dan had prophesied—that they would forget the law of their God and be cut off from the land of their inheritance, from the offspring of Israel, from their family and descendants—so it happened.<br />

        <h3 dir="ltr" >On natural goodness</h3>
        
        <p>1 -1This is a copy of Naphtali's will, as he made his death arrangements when he was one hundred and thirty-two years old. 2On the fourth day of the seventh month, while he was still in good health, his sons gathered together and he prepared a cup of drink for them. 3When he woke up in the morning, he told them,<br />
        “I am dying.”<br />
        But they did not believe him. 4He praised the Lord and confirmed to them that after the banquet he had had the day before, he would die. 5He began to say to his sons,<br />
        “Listen, my sons, descendants of Naphtali, listen to the words of your father. 6I was born by Bala. But because Rachel had acted shrewdly and had given Bala to Jacob instead of herself, and because my mother bore me on Rachel's knees—that is why I was called Naphtali. 7Rachel loved me because I was born on her knees. When I was still a young man, she kissed me and said, “May I see a brother like you born from my womb!”<br />
        8So Joseph was like me in every way because of Rachel’s prayers. 9But my mother is Baalah, daughter of Rotheus, brother of Deborah, Rebekah’s nurse, who was born on the same day as Rachel. 10Rotheus was of the Chaldean lineage of Abraham, a Chaldean, a God-fearing man, free and noble. 11After he was taken prisoner, Laban bought him and gave him his maidservant Enah as a wife. She bore him a daughter, and he named her Zelpha, after the place where he had been taken prisoner. 12Then she gave birth to Baalah and said,<br />
        “My daughter is a woman eager for news, for she is quick to suck her baby from birth.<br />
        ” 21I was as swift on my feet as a deer, so my father Jacob used me as a carrier of news and messages. He also blessed me like a deer.<br />
        2The potter knows his vessel, what capacity it should have, and he uses the appropriate clay for it. So the Lord makes the body in the likeness of the spirit and arranges the spirit according to the strength of the spirit. 3There is no disharmony between one and the other, not even in the slightest, for every creation of the Most High is made according to weight, measure and rule. 4The potter knows the use of each of his vessels, for what it is suited; so the Lord knows the body, how far it will extend in good and how far it will go in evil. 5For there is no form or thought that the Lord does not know; he has created every human being according to his likeness. 6According to his strength, so is his action; according to his mind, so is his achievement; according to his purpose, so is his action. As is his heart, so is his mouth; as is his eye, so is his sleep; and as is his soul, so is his word, according to the law of the Lord or according to the law of Beliar. 7As there is a division between light and darkness, and between sight and hearing, so there is a division between man and man, and between woman and woman; one cannot be said to be alike in appearance and understanding. 8God has made all things beautiful in order: five senses in the head, to which the neck and hair are attached for adornment; then the heart for understanding, the belly for excretion of the stomach, the windpipe for health, the liver for anger, the bile for bitterness, the spleen for laughter, the kidneys for shrewdness, the loins for strength, the ribs for a vessel (for the lungs), the hip for power, and so on. 9So, my children, let all your works be done for good in order, so that you do not do anything disorderly out of contempt or out of season. 10If you were to command your eye to hear, it would not be able to; 3 Do not be hasty in corrupting your actions or deceiving yourselves with empty words. If you keep your silence and are pure in heart, you will learn to hold fast to the will of God and to cast out the will of the devil. 2 The<br />
        sun, the moon, and the stars do not change their order. Do not you also pervert the law of God by the disorder of your actions. 3 The Gentiles, who were mistaken and turned away from the Lord, changed their order; they followed the spirits of error after stones and wood. 4 Do not be like that, my children. Instead, acknowledge the Lord who created everything in the sky and on the earth and the sea, and in all his works, so that you will not be like Sodom, which perverted the order of its nature. 5The Watchers, whom the Lord condemned to the curse of the flood, also changed the order of their nature, because of which he left the earth desert, without fruits or human settlements.<br />
        4 -1I tell you this, my children, because I have read in the sacred book of Enoch that you too will turn away from the Lord, walking in the wickedness of the Gentiles and committing all the wickedness of Sodom. 2The Lord will bring slavery upon you, and there you will serve your enemies; you will be overwhelmed by all kinds of harm and tribulations until the Lord destroys you all. 3But after he has diminished you and reduced you to insignificance, you will return and acknowledge the Lord your God. He will bring you back to your land according to the abundance of his mercy. 4But it will come about that, when you return to the land of your fathers, you will again forget the Lord and act wickedly. 5The Lord will scatter you over the face of the earth until his mercy comes [a man who acts justly and is merciful to all, far and near].<br />
        5 When I was forty years old, I saw in a vision on the Mount of Olives east of Jerusalem that the sun and the moon had stood still. 2 Then Isaac our grandfather said to us,<br />
        “Run and take each one according to his strength; the sun and the moon will be his.<br />
        3 We all ran together. Levi took the sun, and Judah went ahead and took the moon, and they were both taken up with the stars. 4 When Levi was like the sun, a young man handed him twelve palm branches. Judah shone like the moon, and twelve rays of light were under his feet. 5 Levi and Judah ran and took them. 6 There was a bull on the earth with two large horns and eagle wings on its back. We tried to take it, but we could not. 7 Joseph went ahead and took it and went up with it. 8Then I saw that we were in a garden, and a holy scripture appeared to us, saying, "The Assyrians, Medes, Persians, Elamites, [Gelacheans,] Chaldeans, and Syrians will inherit the twelve captive tribes of Israel."<br />
        6 "Again, seven months later, I saw my father Jacob standing at the Sea of ​​Jamnia, and we his sons were with him. 2 And behold, a ship loaded with salted fish came to shore, but without a sailor or a captain. The name Jacob's Ship was engraved on it. 3 "Our father said to us,<br />
        “Let us get on board our ship.” 4So we did, and a violent storm arose, a great gale blowing over us. Our father, who was at the helm, was swept away from us. 5We were carried away by the storm and the ship filled with water and was tossed by great waves until it capsized. 6Joseph fled on a skiff, and we were spread out on ten boards, with Levi and Judah on the same board. 7We all scattered to the farthest reaches of the sea. 8But Levi covered himself with sackcloth and prayed to the Lord for us all. 9When the storm had ceased, the ship drew near to land, as it does when there is a calm. 10And behold, our father Jacob came aboard it, and we all rejoiced with one heart.<br />
        7 Then I told my father about the two dreams. He said to me,<br />
        “These things must happen at their proper time, after Israel has suffered greatly.”<br />
        2 Then my father said,<br />
        “I have faith in God that Joseph is alive; the Lord continually and everywhere counts him as one of us.”<br />
        3 Then he wept and said,<br />
        “You are alive, my son Joseph, but I do not see you, and you do not see Jacob, your father.<br />
        ” 4 At this, we also wept. My heart was burning with desire to tell him that Joseph had been sold, but I was afraid of my brothers.<br />
        8 “See, my sons, how I have shown you the last times, for this is how everything will happen in Israel. 2 So command your sons to be one with Levi and Judah, for<br />
        through him salvation will come to Israel,<br />
        and Jacob will be blessed in him.”<br />
        3Through his tribe God will be revealed<br />
        on earth<br />
        to save the house of Israel ,<br />
        and he will gather the righteous from among the Gentiles.<br />
        4If you do good, my children,<br />
        men and angels will bless you,<br />
        and God will be glorified among the Gentiles through you.<br />
        The devil will flee from you, and the beasts will fear you.<br />
        5If a man brings up his son properly, he will be remembered well; likewise, a good work is remembered well before God.<br />
        6But he who does not do good<br />
        will be cursed by angels and men;<br />
        God will be deprived of glory among the Gentiles for his sake,<br />
        and the devil will dwell in him as in his own vessel.<br />
        The beasts will rule over him,<br />
        and the Lord will hate him.<br />
        7For the commandments of the law are twofold,<br />
        and they must be kept with prudence.<br />
        8For there is a time for union with one's wife,<br />
        and a time for abstaining from prayer.<br />
        9These two things are commandments, and if they do not occur in their order, they cause a man to commit sin. And so it is with the rest of the precepts. 10Be therefore wise in God and prudent, and know the order of his commandments and the laws of every matter, so that the Lord may love you.<br />
        9 - 1After ordering them many such things, he commanded them to carry his bones to Hebron and bury him with his fathers. 2He ate and drank with joy, then covered his face and died.<br />
        3His sons did everything that Naphtali his father commanded them.</p>

        <h3 dir="ltr" >Hebrew Testament of Naphtali</h3>
        
        <p>This is the Testament of Naphtali son of Jacob.<br />
        1 -1The Testament of Naphtali. Naphtali son of Jacob, whom Bala, Rachel's servant, bore. God's struggles.<br />
        When Naphtali was old and had reached a good old age, having reached the end in full strength and fulfilling the duties of a man who walks bent over, he began to command his sons. He said to them,<br />
        "My sons, come, approach and receive the commands of your father."<br />
        2They answered,<br />
        "We are here to hear and do everything you command us. "<br />
        3Naphtali added,<br />
        "I have no command for you concerning my silver and gold, nor concerning the riches I am leaving for you under the sun. I am not going to command you to do difficult things that you can do, but I am telling you something easy that you can do.<br />
        4Then his sons answered him a second time,<br />
        “Speak to us, father; we will hear you.”<br />
        5Naphtali continued,<br />
        “I give you no other commandment than to fear God. You shall serve him and hold fast to him. ”<br />
        6They said to him,<br />
        “What need does he have of us?”<br />
        He said to them,<br />
        “He has no need of any creature, but all the creatures of the world have need of him. God did not create the world in vain, but that his creatures might fear him and that no one should do to his neighbor what he would not want done to him.”<br />
        7They said,<br />
        “Our father, have you seen that we have turned aside to the left or to the right from your ways or from the ways of our fathers?”<br />
        8He said to them,<br />
        “The LORD and I are witnesses that it is so, just as you have said.” But I fear the times to come, that you will wander after foreign gods and walk according to the precepts of the peoples of the land and join the sons of Joseph rather than the sons of Levi and Judah.”<br />
        9They asked him,<br />
        “What do you see that makes you give us such orders?”<br />
        10Naphtali answered,<br />
        “Because I know that the sons of Joseph will turn away from the LORD, the God of our fathers, and will cause the sons of Israel to sin and go into captivity from a good land to a foreign land, just as we went into slavery because of them in Egypt.<br />
        2 “I will also tell you about the vision I saw while I was tending the flock. 2And I saw my twelve brothers keeping the flock with me in the field. Then our father came and said to us,<br />
        “My sons, run, and each of you take his share according to his ability.”<br />
        3We answered him,<br />
        “What shall we drink? We see nothing but the sun, the moon, and the stars.”<br />
        He replied,<br />
        “Take them.”<br />
        4When Levi heard this, he took a staff in his hand, jumped up toward the sun, sat down, and rode on it. 5When Judah saw this, he did the same. He took another staff, jumped up toward the moon, and rode on it. 6The other tribes did the same. Each of them rode on his own star and planet in the sky. Only Joseph was left alone on the earth. 7Then our father Jacob said to him,<br />
        “My son, why have you not acted like your brothers? ”<br />
        He replied,<br />
        “My father, what interest do those born of women have in heaven? They will have to stay on the earth.<br />
        ” 3When Joseph finished speaking, a large bull appeared beside him. It had large wings like a stork, and its horns were strong like a buffalo’s. 2Jacob said to him,<br />
        “Joseph, my son, go up and ride it.”<br />
        3So Joseph went up and rode the bull. Then Jacob our father left us. 4For four hours Joseph rejoiced on the bull. For a while he walked and ran, and for a while he flew, until he came near Judah. ​​Then he waved a banner that was in his hand and began to beat Judah his brother. 5Judah said to him,<br />
        “My brother, why are you hitting me?”<br />
        6Joseph replied,<br />
        “Because you have twelve staffs in your hand and I have only one. Give me ten and there will be peace.”<br />
        7But Judah refused to give them to him. So Joseph beat him until he took all ten from him against his will, so that only two were left in Judah’s hand. 8Joseph said to his ten brothers,<br />
        “What do you want to do if you chase after Judah and Levi? Leave them and come after me.”<br />
        9When the brothers heard these words from Joseph, they left Levi and Judah as one man to follow him. Only Benjamin and Levi remained with Judah. ​​10When Levi saw him, he came down from the sun in a great distress. 11Joseph said to his brother Benjamin,<br />
        “Benjamin, my brother, are you not a brother? Come with me too.”<br />
        But Benjamin refused to go with his brother Joseph. 12As the day drew to a close, a stormy wind came up and separated Joseph from his brothers, so that not even two of them remained together.<br />
        13When I had seen this vision, I told it to my father Jacob. He said to me,<br />
        “My son, this dream will not come true, because it has not been repeated twice.”<br />
        4 It was not long before I saw a second vision. We were all with our Jacob on the shore of the Great Sea. 2 Then I saw a ship sailing on the sea, with no sailors or passengers. 3 Our father said to us,<br />
        “Do you see what I see?”<br />
        We answered, “You are the one who sees me.”<br />
        “We see it too.”<br />
        4He said,<br />
        “Look at me and do likewise.”<br />
        Jacob stripped off his clothes and jumped into the sea. We do the same. 5Levi and Judah jumped in first, and Jacob with them. 6The ship had everything in the world on it. 7Our father Jacob said to them,<br />
        “Please look at the mast and see what is written on it. There is not a ship without its owner’s name written on the mast.”<br />
        8Levi and Judah looked closely and saw an inscription: “This ship belongs to the son of Berechiel, along with all the goods in it.” 9When our father Jacob heard this, he rejoiced and fell on his knees and praised the LORD, blessed be He, and said,<br />
        “He has blessed me not only on land but also on the sea. ”<br />
        10Then he said to us,<br />
        “My sons, act like warriors, and whatever each of you takes will be your portion.”<br />
        11So Levi jumped onto the mainmast of the ship and sat on it. 12After him, Judah jumped onto the mizzenmast next to Levi’s and sat on it as well. 13The rest of my brothers each took his oar. Our father Jacob took the two rudders with which to steer the ship. 14Only Joseph remained alone. Our father said to him,<br />
        “Joseph, my son, you also take the oar.”<br />
        But Joseph would not. 15When our father saw that Joseph refused to take the oar, he said to him,<br />
        “Come here, my son, and take hold of one of the rudders and steer the ship. Your brothers will row until we get close to land.”<br />
        16Then he instructed each of us,<br />
        “This is how you are to steer the ship. Do not be afraid of the waves of the sea or the stormy wind when it blows against you.”<br />
        5 When he had finished his instructions, he left us. 2Joseph took both helms, one with his right hand and the other with his left, and the rest of my brothers rowed. The ship sailed and glided along the surface of the sea. 3Levi and Judah sat on the masts to see which way the ship would go. 4As long as Joseph and Judah were in agreement, with Joseph giving Joseph directions and steering the ship, it sailed smoothly and without incident. 5But after a while there was a dispute between Joseph and Judah, and he would not steer the ship according to the words of our father and the instructions of Judah. ​​The ship went off course, and the waves of the sea beat against the rocks until it capsized.<br />
        6 Then Levi and Judah climbed down from the masts to escape. The rest of my brothers, each of us, also escaped to land. 2 Our father Jacob came and found us scattered, each to his own place. 3 He said to us,<br />
        “What is the matter, my sons? Perhaps you have not steered the ship as I commanded you. ”<br />
        4 We said to him,<br />
        “As your servants live, we have not departed from what you commanded us. But Joseph has transgressed your word. He has not steered the ship as you commanded him or as Judah and Levi commanded him out of envy of them. ”<br />
        5 Jacob said,<br />
        “Show me where it is.”<br />
        He looked and saw that the tops of the masts were visible and that it was floating on the surface of the water. 6Our father whistled, and we all gathered around him. 7He threw himself into the sea as before and repaired the ship. 8Then he rebuked Joseph, saying,<br />
        “My son, do not continue your deceit and jealousy toward your brothers, for they have all nearly perished because of you.”<br />
        7When I told him this vision, my father clapped his hands and sighed, and tears fell from his eyes. 2I waited in shame, but he did not say a word to me. 3I took his hand, pressed it, and kissed it. I said to him,<br />
        “Alas! Servant of the LORD, why do you shed tears?”<br />
        4He said to me,<br />
        “My son, when your vision is repeated, my heart is crushed and my body is crushed because of Joseph, my son, because I loved him more than all of you. But because of Joseph's wickedness you will be led into slavery and scattered among the nations. 5The first vision and the second are one. Therefore, my sons, I command you not to associate with the sons of Joseph, but with the sons of Levi and Judah.<br />
        ​​8 "I also tell you that my portion will be in the best part of the land; you will eat and be satisfied with the finest. 2But I warn you not to go about kicking and trampling when you are in your delicacies, nor to be rebellious against the command of the LORD, who satisfies you with the best of the land. 3Do not forget the LORD, our God and the God of your ancestors, who chose our father Abraham when the tribes were separated in the time of Peleg. 4For then the Holy One came down from high heaven and sent down sixty ministering angels with Michael at their head. 5He commanded each of them to teach the seventy families that came from the loins of Noah the seventy languages. 6Immediately the angels came down and did as the Creator had commanded them. But the holy language, Hebrew, remained only in the houses of Shem and Eber and in the house of Abraham, our father, who was one of their descendants.<br />
        9 On that day Michael brought a message from the Holy One, blessed be He, and spoke thus to each of the seventy nations separately:<br />
        2 “You know the rebellion you have committed and the plot you have plotted against the Lord of heaven and earth. But choose now, this day, whom you will serve and who will be your intercessor on high.”<br />
        3The wicked Nimrod answered thus:<br />
        “There is no one greater to me than the one who taught me and my people in one hour the language of Cush.”<br />
        4Put, Mizraim, Tubal, Javan, Musek and Tiras also answered, and likewise each nation chose its angel, but not one nation remembered the name of the Holy One, blessed be He.<br />
        5Michael said to Abraham our father:<br />
        “Whom will you choose and whom will you serve?”<br />
        Abraham said,<br />
        “I choose and choose only him who spoke a word, and the world was created, who formed me in my mother's womb as a body within a body, and who placed within me spirit and soul. Him I will choose, and to him I will cleave, I and my descendants, forever.”<br />
        10 Then the Most High scattered all the nations and allotted to each their lot and portion. 2 From that time on, all the peoples of the earth turned away from the Holy One, except the house of Abraham, who alone remained with their Creator to serve him; and after Abraham were Isaac and Jacob. 3 Therefore, I adjure you, my sons, that you do not turn away from him, and that you shall not serve any other god except the one your fathers chose. 4You know that there is no one like him, no one who can do as he does in the works of heaven and earth, and no one who can do wonders like his mighty deeds. 5You can understand a part of his strength from the creation of man, how many wonders are in him! 6He created him from head to foot, with his ears to hear, his eyes to see, his mind to understand, and his nose to smell. With his windpipe he utters his voice; into his esophagus he puts food and drink; with his tongue he speaks; with his mouth he completes (teaching?); with his hands he does his work; with his heart he makes plans; with his spleen he laughs, and with his liver he is irritated; with his stomach he digests; with his feet he walks; with his lungs (serve) for breathing, and with his kidneys he receives advice.<br />
        7None of its members changes its function, but each one remains within its own sphere. 8Therefore it is good for a man to have all these things firmly established in his heart: Who was his Creator; who formed him from a stinking drop in the womb of a woman; who brought him into the light of the world and gave him the light of the eyes and the walking of the feet; who made him stand and placed him on his foundation and place; who prepared good rewards for him in the seat of his understanding; who poured out upon him the breath of life and the pure spirit that comes from him. 9Happy is the man who does not defile the holy and divine spirit that has been placed and breathes within him. Happy is he if he returns it as pure to the Creator as on the day it was given to him.<br />
        10This is the word of Naphtali son of Israel, with which he exhorted his children with words that are sweeter than honey.<br />

        <h2 dir="ltr" >GAD'S WILL</h2>
        
        <h3 dir="ltr" >On hate</h3>
        
        <p>1 -1This is a copy of Gad's will, which he spoke to his sons when he was one hundred and twenty-five years old. He said to them:<br />
        2“I was the ninth son of Jacob, and I was a mighty shepherd. 3I kept watch over the flock at night. When a lion, wolf, panther, bear, or any other wild beast came near the sheepfold, I would chase it down, seize it by the leg, spin it around, and stun it. Then I would chase it with my spear for two stadia, and so I would kill it. 4Joseph stayed with us for thirty days tending the flock, but because he was weak, he became ill from the heat. 5So he returned to Hebron to his father, and his father made him lie down with him because he loved him. 6Joseph said to our father,<br />
        “The sons of Zelpha and Bala slaughter the best of the cattle and eat them, against the will of Judah and Reuben.<br />
        7He had seen that I had taken a lamb from the mouth of a bear, killed the bear, and slaughtered the lamb—to my great sorrow, for it could no longer live—and that we had eaten it. And Joseph had told this to our father. 8I was angry with him for this until the day he was sold to Egypt. 9The spirit of hatred resided in me, and I did not want to see or hear about Joseph. He even rebuked us because we had eaten the young without Judah. ​​And in everything I said to our father I convinced him.<br />
        2 I now confess my sin, my sons, for many times I wanted to kill him. I hated him with all my soul, and there was no compassion in my bowels for him. 2My hatred also increased because of his dreams, and I wanted to wipe him out from the land of the living as a calf tears grass from the ground. 3So Judah and I sold him to the Ishmaelites for thirty pieces of gold. We hid ten of them and showed the remaining twenty to our brothers. 4So I decided to kill him out of greed. 5But the God of my fathers saved him from my hand so that he would not commit any wicked act in Israel.<br />
        3 Listen, my sons, to my righteous words, so that you may do what is right and obey all the law of the Most High. Do not be deceived by the spirit of hatred, for this is an evil that pervades all the actions of men. 2Everything that is done is evil in the eyes of the one who is filled with hatred. If anyone obeys the law of the Lord, he does not praise him; if someone fears the Lord and desires what is right, he does not like it. 3He reproaches the truth, envies the prosperous, welcomes slander, and loves pride. Hatred blinds his soul. This is how I saw Joseph.<br />
        4 Beware, my children, of hatred, for it commits wicked acts, even against the Lord. 2 It refuses to listen to the words of His precepts about loving one's neighbor and sins against God. 3 If a brother does something wrong, he immediately wants to announce it to everyone and is quick to have him judged and put to death for it. 4 If it is a servant, he throws him before his master and plots with all kinds of pressures to see if he can kill him. 5 Hatred works with envy against those who are successful; hearing and seeing their progress, it feels sick. 6 Love even wants to raise the dead and longs to keep alive those who are about to perish; but hatred, on the contrary, wants to kill the living and does not want to let live those who have erred even the slightest. 7 The spirit of hatred, with its narrowness of vision, works with Satan in everything to bring about the death of men. The spirit of love, on the other hand, with its openness of heart, cooperates with the law of God for the salvation of men.<br />
        5 -1Hatred is evil because it continually unites itself with lies, speaks against the truth, makes small things great, presents darkness as light, claims that sweet is bitter, teaches slander, anger, hostility, violence and all kinds of evils, and fills the heart with diabolical poison. 2All this I tell you, my children, from my own experience, so that you may turn away from hatred and cling to the love of the Lord. 3Righteousness drives out hatred, and humility annihilates it. The righteous and humble are ashamed of committing injustice, not because someone accuses them, but because of their own heart, because the Lord guards their mind. 4He does not slander anyone, because the fear of the Lord overcomes hatred. 5Out of fear of offending God, he does not at all desire to do injustice to anyone, not even in thought. 6I realized all this at last after I repented of Joseph. 7True godly repentance destroys ignorance, puts darkness to flight, enlightens the eyes, gives knowledge to the soul, and guides the mind to salvation. 8For what it does not learn from men it learns through repentance. 9The Lord afflicted me with a liver ailment. And my spirit would have almost departed from me had it not been for the prayers of my father Jacob. 10For wherever a man sins, there he receives his punishment.<br />
        11Because my heart was unmerciful toward Joseph, I was condemned to suffer unmercifully in my heart for eleven months, the same length of time that I stood with Joseph until he was sold.<br />
        6 Now, my sons, let each one love his brother; remove hatred from your hearts by loving one another in deed, word, and thought. 2 For I spoke peaceable words to Joseph in my father's presence. But when I went out, the spirit of hatred darkened my mind and troubled my soul to destroy him. 3 Therefore love one another from the heart. If anyone sins against you, tell him in peace, putting aside the poison of hatred and not harboring deceit in your soul. And if he confesses his sin and repents, forgive him. 4 If he denies it, do not enter into a dispute with him, or he will become stubborn in oaths and you will commit a double sin. 5 During a dispute, do not let a stranger hear your secret, or he will become your enemy out of hatred and commit a great sin against you. For he will often speak deceitfully to you or take care of your affairs with evil intentions, taking poison from you.] 6But if he denies it and is ashamed of feeling rejected, be still and do not argue with him any longer, for he who denies shows signs of repentance. He will not offend you any more, but will honor you, fear you, and keep peace with you. 7But if he is shameless and persists in wickedness, forgive him from your heart, and leave vengeance to God.<br />
        7 -1If someone prospers more than you, do not grieve, but pray for him that he may prosper to the end; perhaps it will be good for you. 2If he is exalted above measure, do not be envious, remembering that every man must die. Instead, sing a hymn to the Lord, who gives good and suitable things to all men. 3Search the judgments of the Lord, and he will not forsake you and will give peace to your mind. 4If anyone becomes rich by his wicked deeds, like my uncle Esau, do not envy him. Wait until the Lord puts a stop to him. 5For he will either take away his wealth in trouble, or forgive him if he repents, or reserve him for eternal punishment. 6A poor man who does not envy and gives thanks to the Lord for everything is richer than others, because he does not have the wicked cares of men. 7So put hatred out of your souls and love one another with uprightness of heart.<br />
        8“Pass these things on to your children, so that they will honor Judah and Levi, for from them the Lord will raise up the Savior of Israel. 2I know that in the end your children will turn away from them and live before the Lord in every kind of wickedness, wickedness and depravity.<br />
        3After resting for a while, he said to them again,<br />
        “My sons, obey your father: bury me near my ancestors.”<br />
        4He drew up his feet and fell asleep in peace. 5Five years later, they brought him up and buried him in Hebron, near his ancestors.<br />

        <h2 dir="ltr" >TESTAMENT OF ASHER</h2>
        
        <h3 dir="ltr" >On the two faces of evil and virtue</h3>
        
        <p>1 -1A copy of Asher's testament, of the words he spoke to his sons when he was one hundred and twenty-five years old. 2He was still in good health when he said to them:<br />
        "Listen, you sons of Asher, to your father, and I will show you everything that is right before God. 3He gave two ways to men, two minds, two actions, two ways (of life) and two ends. 4For this reason, all things exist in pairs, one opposite the other. 5There are two ways, of good and evil, and for them there are two faculties in our chest that judge them. 6If the soul intends to be on the right path, all its actions are executed in justice, and if it ever sins, it immediately repents. 7For, by thinking rightly and throwing away perversion, the soul quickly overthrows evil and eradicates sin. 8But if the mind inclines toward evil, all its actions will be executed in evil. By rejecting good and embracing evil, he is overcome by Beliar, and even if he does something good, it will be turned into evil. 9Even if he begins as if he were doing something good, the purpose of his action will drive him to do evil, for the treasury of the mind is filled with the poison of the evil spirit.<br />
        2 -1There are souls who affirm in word the preponderance of good over evil, but the purpose of their action leads them to the latter. 2There are men... who have no compassion for the one who helps them in evil: this too has two sides, but the whole is evil. 3There are also men who love the one who does evil and are so immersed in evil that, for the sake of the evil one, they choose to die in it. This is clear that this has two sides, but the whole is evil. 4Even if there is love, it is evil, for it hides evil within itself. What is good in word becomes evil at the end of the action. 5Another steals, commits injustice, plunders, defrauds, yet has compassion on the poor. This too has two sides, but the whole is evil. 6By defrauding his neighbor, he provokes God to anger and swears falsely by the Most High, yet has compassion on the poor. He despises the Lord who gives the law and angers him, yet gives relief to the poor. 7He defiles the soul but beautifies the body; he destroys many but has compassion on a few. This too has two sides, but the whole is evil. 8Another commits adultery and fornication, yet abstains from food. He does evil while fasting, and by his power and wealth he flays many, yet by his very wickedness he keeps the commandments. This too has two sides, but the whole is evil. 9 Such people are like pigs and hares, which are half pure but are actually unclean. 10 For God has made this clear on the heavenly tablets.<br />
        3 My children, do not be double-faced like them, both good and evil. Hold fast to goodness, for God rests on it, and men desire it. 2 Flee from evil, destroying the devil by your good deeds. For the double-faced do not serve God, but their own desires to please Beliar and men who are like them.<br />
        4 Good and single-faced men, though they appear to err in the eyes of the double-faced, are righteous before God. 2 Many who kill the wicked perform two works, one good through another evil, but the whole is good, because they eradicate the evil and cause it to perish. 3 There is one who hates the merciful but unjust, the adulterer who also fasts. This, too, is two-sided, but the whole work is good, because it imitates the Lord, not accepting what seems good in place of what is true. 4Another does not wish to see a good day in the company of dissolute people, so as not to defile his mouth or defile his soul. This, too, is two-sided, but the whole is good. 5These are like gazelles and fawns, for in their wild condition they seem to be unclean animals, but in reality they are completely pure. They act with divine zeal, keeping away from those things which God hates and forbids by his commandments, separating the evil from the good.<br />
        5See, then, my children, how there are two sides to everything, one opposite the other and one hidden by the other. In wealth (is hidden) greed; in joy, drunkenness; in laughter, lamentations; in marriage, lust. 2Life is succeeded by death; honor, dishonor; The day is night, and the light is darkness. All things are under the day, and righteousness is under life. Therefore, death is the place where eternal life awaits. 3No one can say that truth is false, or that righteousness is unrighteous, for all truth is under the light, just as everything is under the divine. 4I have tested all these things throughout my life, and I have not been swayed from the truth of the Lord. I have searched for the commandments of the Most High with all my strength, walking toward what is good with one mind.<br />
        6 My children, you too must pay attention to the commandments of the Lord, and follow the truth with one face. 2 Those who are two-faced will be punished twice, because they do evil and join in with those who do evil. Hate the spirits of error who fight against men. 3 Keep the law of the Lord and do not pay attention to evil as if it were good. Consider what is truly good and hold on to it through the commandments of the Lord, turning to it and thus establishing your rest. 4 For the end of men shows their justice, being known by the angels of the Lord and of Beliar. 5 But if the soul goes away troubled, it is tormented by the evil spirit whom it served with its lusts and evil deeds. 6 But if it goes away quietly and joyfully, it comes to know the angel of peace, who leads it to eternal life.<br />
        7 My children, do not be like Sodom, which did not know the angels of the Lord and perished forever. 2 I know that you will sin, that you will be handed over to your enemies, and our land will be desolate. Your sanctuary will be destroyed, and you will be scattered to the four corners of the earth. You will remain in the desert, despised like unusable water until the Most High visits the earth.<br />
        3 [Coming as a man, eating and drinking with them] and safely crushing the dragon's head in the midst of the water: thus he will save Israel and all the nations [God speaking in human form]. 4 Therefore tell your children these things, so that they will not disobey. 5 I have read on the heavenly tablets that you will totally disobey him and commit terrible wickedness against him, not heeding the law of God, but the precepts of men. 6Therefore you will be scattered, like my brothers Gad and Dan, who will not know their land, their tribe, or their language. 7But the Lord will gather you together in hope of his mercy, for the sake of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob."<br />
        8 After he had said this, he said to them,<br />
        "Bury me in Hebron.<br />
        " He died in a peaceful sleep. 2So his sons did as he had commanded them and took him away and buried him with their fathers.<br />

        <h2 dir="ltr" >WILL OF JOSEPH</h2>
        
        <h3 dir="ltr" >On continence</h3>
        
        <p>1 -1Copy of Joseph's will. When he was about to die, he called together his sons and brothers and said to them:<br />
        2—My sons and brothers,<br />
        listen to Joseph, the beloved of Israel;<br />
        listen, children, to your father.<br />
        3I have seen envy and death in my life,<br />
        but I have not strayed because of the faithfulness of the Lord.<br />
        4My brothers hated me,<br />
        but the Lord loved me;<br />
        they sought to kill me,<br />
        but the God of my fathers protected me.<br />
        They lowered me into a cistern,<br />
        but the Most High brought me out.<br />
        5I was sold as a slave,<br />
        but the Lord freed me.<br />
        I was taken into captivity,<br />
        but his mighty hand helped me.<br />
        I was oppressed by hunger,<br />
        but the Lord fed me.<br />
        6I was alone,<br />
        but God comforted me;<br />
        I was sick,<br />
        but the Most High visited me.<br />
        I lay in prison,<br />
        but the Savior had mercy on me.<br />
        I was in chains,<br />
        but he untied me.<br />
        7I was surrounded by slander,<br />
        but he defended me;<br />
        amid the terrible words of the Egyptians,<br />
        but he saved me;<br />
        amid the envy of my fellow servants,<br />
        but he exalted me.<br />
        2 Pharaoh's chamberlain entrusted me with the management of his household. 2 I fought against a shameless woman who urged me to sin with her. But the God of Israel, my father, protected me from the fiery flame. 3 I suffered imprisonment, beatings, and insults, but the Lord made me find mercy before the jailers.<br />
        4 For he does not abandon those who fear him<br />
        in darkness, chains, distress, or need.<br />
        5 For God does not feel shame like a man,<br />
        nor is he terrified like a human being,<br />
        nor, like an earthly being, feel weakness or rejection,<br />
        6 but is present everywhere,<br />
        in various ways offering his comfort.<br />
        He departs briefly<br />
        to test the purposes of the soul.<br />
        7In ten trials she found me faithful, and<br />
        in the midst of them all I kept my spirits up.<br />
        For perseverance is a great medicine,<br />
        and patience brings many benefits.<br />
        3How often did the Egyptian woman threaten me with death! How often did she punish me and call me to her and threaten me because I would not lie with her! She said to me,<br />
        2“You will be my master and all my possessions if you will give yourself to me. You will be like our lord.”<br />
        3But I remembered the words of my father Jacob, and shut myself in my chamber and prayed to the Lord. 4So I fasted for seven years, though I appeared to the Egyptians as one who lives in delight, for those who fast in the Lord's name receive a graceful appearance. 5When my master went out of the house, he drank no wine. For three days he ate no food, but distributed it to the poor and sick. 6I rose early to pray to the Lord and shed tears for the Egyptian woman of Memphite, who kept bothering me. Even at night she came to my house under the pretext of visiting me. 7At first, because she had no male offspring, she pretended to regard me as a son. But I prayed to the Lord, and she gave birth to a son. 8As long as she embraced me as a son, I did not perceive her motives. But at last she tried to draw me into fornication. 9When I realized this, I was grieved to the point of death. When she was not present, I would withdraw into my heart and mourn for her for many days, for I had perceived her deceitful intentions and her error. 10I spoke to her with words from the Most High, to see if she would turn from her evil desire.<br />
        4How often she flattered me with her words, treating me as a holy man, praising my chastity in the sight of her husband with deceitful words, but wishing, when she was alone, to seduce me! 2She praised me publicly as a chaste man, but in private she said to me,<br />
        “Do not be afraid of my husband; he is convinced of your chastity. If anyone tells him about us, he will not believe it.”<br />
        3While this was going on, I slept on the ground, dressed in sackcloth, and prayed to God to deliver me from the Egyptian woman. 4Since she got nothing, she came back to me under the pretext of instruction, to hear the word of the Lord. 5She said to me,<br />
        “If you want me to give up idols, join me, and I will persuade the Egyptian to give up idols and walk in the law of the Lord.”<br />
        6I said to her,<br />
        “God does not want his worshipers to live in impurity, nor does he delight in adulterers.”<br />
        7But she kept silent, longing to satisfy her desire.<br />
        8But I added fasting to prayers that the Lord would deliver me from her.<br />
        5Again she spoke to me,<br />
        “If you do not want to commit adultery, I will kill the Egyptian and take you as my husband.”<br />
        2When I heard her words, I tore my clothes and said,<br />
        “Woman, fear the Lord and do not do this wicked thing, or you will be destroyed. Behold, I will reveal your wicked plan to everyone.”<br />
        3In fear she begged me not to tell anyone of her wickedness.<br />
        4He left there and tried to shower me with gifts, presenting me with all kinds of delicacies.<br />
        6 -1She sent me food mixed with magic potions. 2But when the eunuch who carried them came in, I lifted up my eyes and saw a terrible man who was offering me a sword along with the plate. Then I realized that his cares were intended to entice my soul. 3So I went outside and burst into tears, not tasting either that or any of her other food. 4The next day she came and saw the food and said to me,<br />
        “Why do you not eat this food?”<br />
        I answered,<br />
        5“Because you have filled it with death! How could you say, ‘I will no longer go near idols, but only the Lord’? 6Because the God of my fathers has revealed to me through an angel your wickedness.” I have kept the food so that you may be convinced, that when you see it you may repent, 7and that you may learn that the wickedness of the wicked is powerless against those who worship God in purity.<br />
        8So I took the food before her and ate it. Then I said,<br />
        “The God of my fathers and the angel of Abraham are with me.”<br />
        8She fell face downwards at my feet and began to weep. I lifted her up and rebuked her. 9She promised me that she would never again commit such wickedness.<br />
        7But because her heart was still attached to mine with an impure spirit, she lay prostrate and groaned continually. 2When the Egyptian saw her, he said to her,<br />
        “Why is your face so downcast?”<br />
        He said to her,<br />
        “I am in pain at heart, and the groaning of my spirit distresses me.”<br />
        He tried to comfort her, although she was not really sick. 3She jumped up to me while her husband was away and said,<br />
        “I will hang myself or throw myself into a pit or a cliff if you do not join me.”<br />
        4I realized that the spirit of Beliar was bothering her. So I prayed to the Lord,<br />
        5“Why are you so upset and disquieted, blinded by sin? Remember that if you kill yourself, Setho, your rival’s concubine, will strike your children and destroy your memory from the earth.”<br />
        6She said,<br />
        “Love me! It is enough for me that you care for me and my children; I hope that I will enjoy my desire.”<br />
        7But she did not know that I had spoken this for God, not for her. 8For if a man gives in to the passion of evil desire and is enslaved like this, even if he hears something good, he takes it as something that is spoken for the sake of the passion and evil desire that enslaves him.<br />
        8 -1I assure you, my sons, that it was about three in the afternoon when she left me. Then I bowed my knees before the Lord all that afternoon and continued through the night. I got up in the morning shedding tears and begging for my release from the Egyptian woman. 2But in the end she took me by my clothes and dragged me by force to the bed. 3When I saw that in her madness she was holding on to my clothes, I fled naked.<br />
        4She slandered me, and the Egyptian sent me to the dungeon in his own house. The next day he ordered me to be flogged and sent me to Pharaoh's prison. 5When I was in chains, the Egyptian woman was sick with grief. She heard me singing to the Lord in that dark house and praising my God with joyful voice, if only because I had been freed from the Egyptian woman under that pretext.<br />
        9Many times she sent a messenger to me and said,<br />
        "Please do my bidding, and I will free you from your bonds and lead you out of this darkness."<br />
        2But I did not even think of her, for God prefers a man who fasts in a dark dungeon to one who lives dissolutely in the royal chambers. 3He who lives his life chastely desires the glory that belongs to him, and if the Almighty sees fit, he grants it to him as he did to me. 4How often, even when she was sick, she would come down to my prison early in the morning and hear my voice intoning prayers! But I, hearing her groaning, kept silent. 5When I was in her house, she would uncover her arms, her breast, and her legs so that I might lie with her. She was very beautiful and adorned herself carefully to seduce me, but the Lord protected me from her attempts.<br />
        10 -1Now see, my children, what patience and prayer together with fasting accomplish. 2If you strive to be chaste and pure with patience and humility of heart, the Lord will dwell in you, for he loves chastity. 3Where the Lord is present... even if someone falls into envy, slavery, slander, or prison, the Lord who dwells in him through chastity will not only save him from evil but will exalt him and honor him as he did with me, 4for (such vicissitudes) oppress a man in deed, word, or thought. 5My brothers know how my father loved me and how I was not arrogant in my heart. Although I was young, I kept the fear of God in my mind, because I knew that everything passes. 6I acted moderately and honored my brothers. Out of fear of them I kept silent while I was being sold and did not reveal to the Ishmaelites my lineage, that I was the son of Jacob, a great and mighty man.<br />
        11 -1Keep therefore the fear of God before your eyes in all your actions and honor your brothers, for everyone who keeps the law of the Lord will be loved by him. 2When I came to the Ishmaelites in the land of the Indo-Colpiths, they asked me,<br />
        “Are you a slave?”<br />
        I said,<br />
        “I am a slave, born in my master’s house.<br />
        ” In this way I would not put my brothers to shame. 3But the eldest of them said to me, “Are you a slave?”<br />
        4When we came to Egypt, they argued among themselves about who would give me the money and take me. 5So they all agreed that I should stay in Egypt with the merchant of their goods until they came back with more merchandise. 6But the Lord showed me favor in the eyes of the merchant, and he put me in charge of his household. 7And the Lord blessed him through me and showered him with silver and gold. 8I stayed with him three months and five days.<br />
        12At that time a Memphite woman, the wife of Pentephres, rode by in a grand chariot. She looked at me because her eunuchs had told her about me. 2She told her husband about the merchant, how he had become rich through a young Hebrew man, and how it was said that he had been stolen by stealth from the land of Canaan. She added,<br />
        3“But now do justice to him; take the young man and bring him home. The God of the Hebrews will bless you, for the favor of heaven is upon him.”<br />
        13 Pentephres was persuaded by these words and sent for the merchant and said to him,<br />
        “What is this I hear? You are stealing people from the land of the Hebrews to sell them as slaves?”<br />
        2The merchant fell on his knees and begged him,<br />
        “Please, sir, I do not know what you are saying.”<br />
        3Then he said,<br />
        “Where then did you get the Hebrew slave?”<br />
        The other man said,<br />
        “The Ishmaelites left him here with me until they return.”<br />
        4But Pentephres did not believe her, but ordered him to be stripped and flogged. But when he persisted in his words, Pentephres said,<br />
        “Bring the young man!”<br />
        5When they brought me, I knelt before the chief of the eunuchs. For he was third in rank after Pharaoh, and had authority over the eunuchs. He had a wife, children, and concubines. 6He took me away from the merchant and asked me,<br />
        “Are you a slave or a free man?”<br />
        I replied,<br />
        “A slave.”<br />
        7He said,<br />
        “Whose slave are you?”<br />
        I replied,<br />
        “Of the Ishmaelites.”<br />
        8He said to me,<br />
        “How did you become a slave?”<br />
        I replied,<br />
        “I was bought in the land of Canaan. ”<br />
        9He did not believe me, saying that I was lying. So he ordered me to be stripped and flogged.<br />
        14 The Memphite woman, meanwhile, watched from a window as they beat me. She then sent a messenger to her husband with these words:<br />
        "Your sentence is unjust, because you are punishing a free man who had been robbed as if he had committed a crime."<br />
        2When I would not change my statement despite being beaten, he ordered me to be imprisoned until the slave's owners came, she said. 3His wife said to him,<br />
        "Why are you keeping this noble-born young man prisoner, who should rather be free and serve you?<br />
        4She longed to see me because of her sinful desire." 5Pentephres said to the Memphite,<br />
        "It is not lawful among the Egyptians to seize what belongs to others before the proof is presented."<br />
        6He said this through the merchant. As for me, he thought it necessary for me to remain in prison.<br />
        15 Twenty-four days later the Ishmaelites came. They had heard that Jacob my father was mourning for me. They said to me,<br />
        2"Why did you say that you were a slave? It has now been learned that you are the son of a great man from the land of Canaan. Your father mourns for you in sackcloth."<br />
        3I wanted to cry, but I restrained myself so as not to shame my brothers. I said,<br />
        “I don’t know anything. I am a slave.”<br />
        4Then they decided to sell me so that I would not be found in their hands. 5They were afraid that Jacob would take terrible revenge on them, since they had heard that he was great before the Lord and men. 6Then the merchant said to them,<br />
        “Rescue me from the judgment of Pentephres.”<br />
        7They came to me and begged me to say, ‘He was sold to us for a certain sum,’ so that Pentephres would release us.<br />
        16The Memphite woman told her husband to buy me. She said to him,<br />
        “I have heard that he is being sold.”<br />
        2He sent a eunuch to the Ishmaelites, asking that I be put up for sale. [So the chamberlain called the Ishmaelites and asked them to sell me. 3But he did not want to deal with them, so he went away.] The eunuch consulted with them and said to the mistress,<br />
        “They are asking a high price for the slave.”<br />
        4The Memphite woman sent a second eunuch with these instructions:<br />
        “Even if they ask for two minas of gold for him, do not try to save money; buy the slave and bring him to me.” 5The eunuch gave them eighty gold coins for me, although he told the Egyptian woman that he had given them a hundred. 6I saw it, but I kept silent, so that they would not punish the eunuch.<br />
        17 “See, my sons, how much I endured so that I would not bring shame upon my brothers. 2 “Love one another, then, and hide your weaknesses from each other with generosity. 3 For God is pleased with good harmony among brothers and with the purpose of the heart that finds pleasure in love. 4 “When my brothers came to Egypt, let them know that I had returned their money and that I had not covered them with insults but had comforted them. 5 After Jacob died, I loved them even more and did more than he had commanded, and they were filled with admiration. 6 I did not let them be upset even over the smallest thing, and I gave them everything in my power. 7 Their children were mine, and my children were their servants. Their soul was mine, and any pain on their part was as if it were mine; any weakness on their part was as if it were my own. My land was theirs, and my purposes were theirs. I did not exalt myself among them for the sake of my worldly glory, but I was among them as one of the least of them.<br />
        18 If you then walk according to the commandments of the Lord, my sons, he will exalt you here on earth and bless you with good things forever. 2 If anyone wishes to harm you, pray for him with eagerness to do good, and the Lord will deliver you from all evil. 3 See then that for my magnanimity I took the daughter of my masters as a wife, and they gave her to me a hundred talents of gold, for the Lord made them my servants. 4 The Lord himself gave me beauty like a flower, surpassing that of the most beautiful of Israel. He kept me until old age with strength and beauty, for I am in every way like Jacob.<br />
        19 Hear also, my sons, the dreams I have had. 2And twelve deer were feeding; nine were divided and scattered over the earth, and the other three were likewise... 8 [I saw that a virgin was born out of Judah, adorned with a linen garment.] And from her came a lamb [without blemish], and at her left hand was something like a lion. All the wild beasts rushed at him, but the lamb conquered them and destroyed them under his feet. 9And angels, men, and all the earth rejoiced in him. 10All this will happen in its time, in the last days. 11My children, keep the commandments of the Lord and honor Judah and Levi, for from them will arise for you the Lamb [of God], who will save [with his grace all the Gentiles and] Israel. 12For his kingdom is eternal, it will not pass away; but my kingdom among you will come to an end like a shed during the harvest, which does not last after the summer.<br />
        20 I know that after my death the Egyptians will afflict you, but the Lord will avenge you and bring you back to the land promised to your fathers. 2 Take my bones with you, too, for the Lord will be with you as they are carried away with light, but Beliar will be with the Egyptians in darkness. 3 Bring up your mother Zelpah and place her near Baalah, near Rachel, in the hippodrome. 4 After he had said all this, he stretched out his feet and fell into a deep sleep. 5 Israel and Egypt mourned for him greatly. 6 He had compassion on the Egyptians and did good to them as to his own members, helping them with every deed, counsel, and action.</p>

        Expansion of the Slavic text to TestJos 19,12 (text by N. Tichonravov)</p>
        
        <p>Hear then, O Jews, what is the meaning of Joseph's dream: I saw twelve deer feeding. These deer are the twelve apostles, who foretell wonders in the world. Nine of them, he said, went out into the whole earth, teaching and baptizing in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. In the same way, the other three also preached the gospel and died without leaving Jerusalem.<br />
        As Scripture says, James, John's brother, was killed with the sword by the impious Herod. Likewise Stephen, the so-called first martyr, was stoned to death by the Jews. He cried out,<br />
        "Lord, do not hold this sin against them, for they do not know what they are doing.<br />
        I see," he said, "that a virgin has come out of Judah, that is, the holy one of the tribe of Judah, the daughter of Joachim, dressed in purple, pure and blameless, holy and more than holy. From her comes the immaculate lamb, the Son of God, humble, without malice or malice, and who knows no sin. And at his left hand is something like a lion. This is the Word of his Godhead, great, terrible, and well-marked, against which all the wild beasts rush, that is, you, unhappy Jews, who have seen the Son of God taking on a humble appearance. But all of them rushed at him like wild beasts, saying,<br />
        “Seize him, seize him, crucify him.<br />
        His blood be on you and your children!<br />
        ” “The lamb conquered them,” he said. “That is, the Son of God rose from the dead, whom you remembered only to do evil.<br />
        But he destroyed them, trampling them underfoot.” That is, he will divide you as slaves among the nations, and you will be trampled down until now in your land. At this, he said, angels and men and all the earth rejoiced. The Lord, your God, King of heaven and earth, unites the upper and the lower in one blessed blessing. All this, he said, will be fulfilled in its proper time. Now Jacob was seventy-three years old; and the Son of God (Joseph?) was born in the ninth year, and they rejoiced over him in the last days. To him is the beginning and the end. He, first of all, passed from nonexistence to existence, and of this the prophets spoke. And we will rejoice in him to the last days.<br />
        You, my children, he said, keep the commandments of the Lord and honor Judah and Levi, for from these will come forth for you the divine Lamb, that is, from the tribe of Judah and according to the Levitical order. He will receive hegemony and will save by his grace all peoples and Israel. Consider this, Israel, for salvation is not only for you, but for all peoples, to the extent that he was not born only to save Israel. He was born of a holy virgin and led all peoples to salvation. His kingdom is eternal. Consider that the virgin does not foreshadow another lamb and that his kingdom will never pass away.<br />

        <h2 dir="ltr" >BENJAMIN'S WILL</h2>
        
        <h3 dir="ltr" >On the cleansing of thoughts</h3>
        
        <p>1 -1This is the copy of the words of Benjamin, as he gave his sons after he had lived a hundred and twenty-five years. 2He kissed them and said to them,<br />
        “Isaac was born to Abraham when he was a hundred years old; I was born to Jacob at the same age. 3Rachel died giving birth to me, so she had no milk, but Bala, her maid, nursed me. 4Rachel gave birth to Joseph and was barren for twelve years. But she prayed to the Lord with fasting for twelve days, and conceived and gave birth to me. 5Our father loved Rachel very much and prayed to God to grant him to see two sons born to her. 6That is why they called me Benjamin, which means “son of days.”<br />
        2 - 1When I came to Egypt and my brother Joseph recognized me, he asked me,<br />
        “What did you say to my father when you sold me?”<br />
        2I replied,<br />
        “They stained your tunic with blood and sent it to him with the words, ‘See if this is your son’s tunic. ’”<br />
        3Joseph said,<br />
        “Yes, brother. When the Ishmaelites seized me, one of them stripped me of my tunic and gave me something to cover myself with. After whipping me, he ordered me to walk. 4But as I was about to hide my tunic, a lion met him and killed him. 5So his fellow Ishmaelites were afraid and sold me to other fellow Ishmaelites.<br />
        3 “So, my sons, love the Lord, the God of heaven, and keep his commandments, imitating Joseph, a good and holy man. 2Let your mind be set on what is good, as you know I do. A sound mind looks straight to everything. 3Fear the Lord and love your neighbor. Though the spirits of Beliar seek to overwhelm you with all kinds of evil and distress, they will not rule over you, any more than they did over my brother Joseph. 4How many men sought to kill him! But the Lord protected him. For he who fears God and loves his neighbor cannot be struck by the ethereal spirit of Beliar, protected as he is by the fear of God. 5The wiles of men and wild beasts will not rule over him, for he is aided by the love of God, which he has for his neighbor. 6Joseph begged our father to pray for his sons, that the Lord would not hold against them the evil they had plotted against him. 7And Jacob cried out,<br />
        “My son Joseph, my good son! You have stirred up the heart of your father Jacob.”<br />
        And she put her arms around him and kissed him for two hours, saying,<br />
        8 "In you will be fulfilled the prophecy from heaven [about the Lamb of God and savior of the world: he, without blemish, will be handed over to the unbelievers; the innocent will die for the wicked in the blood of the covenant], for the salvation [of the nations and] of Israel, thereby destroying Beliar and his servants.<br />
        4 My children, behold, the end of the good man. Imitate his compassionate heart with kindness of thought, so that you too may wear the crowns of glory. 2 The good man has no dark eyes, for he has mercy on all, even sinners. 3 Even if evil is plotted against him, he overcomes evil by doing good, protected by kindness; and he loves the righteous as himself. 4 If anyone receives praise, he does not envy. If anyone becomes rich, he does not jealous. If anyone is brave, he praises him; he believes and exalts the wise, he has mercy on the poor, he pities the sick, he sings hymns to God. 5 He protects those who fear God, he works with those who love him, he converts those who deny the Most High with his rebukes, and he loves those who have the grace of the good Spirit with all his soul.<br />
        5 If you are right-minded, my children, even wicked men will have peace with you, and the dissolute will turn to good out of respect for you; the greedy will not only turn away from their passion, but will give the produce of their greed to the afflicted. 2 If you do good, even unclean spirits will turn away from you, and the beasts themselves will fear you. 3 For where there is light in the mind (which translates) into good works, darkness flees. 4 If someone harms a pious man, (in them) he bears penance, for the Holy One has mercy on the insulter and remains silent. 5 If someone betrays a righteous soul, it will turn to prayer; it will be humiliated for a short time, but not long after it will appear with greater brilliance, just as it happened to Joseph, my brother.<br />
        6 - 1The mind of a good man is not in the power of Beliar, the spirit of error, for the angel of peace guides his soul. 2(The good man) does not look with passion at the perishable nor does he accumulate riches for the sake of pleasure. 3He does not delight in pleasures; he does not cause sorrow to his neighbor, he does not saturate himself with fine dishes, he is not enticed by the sight of his eyes, for his heritage is the Lord. 4The good mind does not tolerate honor or dishonor from men; it knows nothing of pain and deceit, of dispute and insult, for (the Lord) dwells in him, enlightens his soul and is an object of joy to all men at all times. 5The upright mind does not have two tongues, one for blessing and another for cursing, for insult and honor, for sorrow and joy, for tranquility and turmoil, hypocrisy and truth [poverty and wealth], but it maintains towards all one disposition, simple and pure. 6He does not have double vision or hearing, for he knows that in everything he does, speaks or looks, the Lord watches over his soul. 7He keeps his mind pure so that he will not be condemned by God or man. But all the works of Beliar are double, and he does not know simplicity.<br />
        7 Therefore, my sons, flee from the wickedness of Beliar, for he gives a sword to those who obey him. 2 This sword is the mother of seven evils. [First, the mind conceives under the influence of Beliar.] First, envy; second, destruction; third, distress; fourth, captivity; fifth, need; sixth, turmoil; seventh, desolation. 3 Therefore, Cain was delivered by God to seven punishments: every hundred years the Lord would bring upon him a plague. 4 When he was two hundred years old, he began to suffer, and when he was nine hundred he was deprived (of life) by the flood because of Abel, his righteous brother. Cain was condemned to seven evils, but Lamech to seventy-seven. 5 Those who resemble Cain in envying his brother will be punished forever with the same punishment.<br />
        8 “Therefore, my children, flee from wickedness, envy, and brotherly hatred, and hold fast to kindness and love. 2 He who is pure in love does not look at a woman to commit fornication, for there is no impurity in his heart, for the Spirit of God dwells in him. 3 The sun is not stained when it shines on dung and mire, but it dries up both and drives away the stench. Likewise, the pure mind, constrained to live among the miasmas of the earth, is edified (spiritually), but is not defiled.<br />
        9 “I understand from the Words of Enoch the righteous that there will be among you deeds that are not good. You will commit fornication after the manner of Sodom and will perish except for a few. You will revive the lust for women, and the kingdom of God will not be among you, for He Himself will remove it. 2But the temple of God will be in your inheritance, and the twelve tribes and all the peoples will gather there until the Most High sends salvation through the visitation of the only begotten prophet. 3He<br />
        will enter the first temple; there he will be reviled, despised, and exalted on a tree. 4The veil of the temple will be torn, and the Spirit of God will spread out to the nations like spreading fire. 5He will ascend from Hades to heaven from the earth. I have seen how lowly he will be on earth and how glorious he will be in heaven.<br />
        10When Joseph was in Egypt, I longed to see his face and all his appearance and form. At the prayers of my father Jacob I saw him, awake during the day, as he was.<br />
        2Know, my children, that I am dying. 3Let each one of you deal truthfully and justly with his neighbor. Act faithfully and keep the law of the Lord and his commandments. 4I am leaving you these teachings as an inheritance. Pass them on to your children so that they may keep them forever, for this is what Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob did. 5They gave us all these things as an inheritance, ordering us to keep the commandments of the Lord until he reveals his salvation to all nations. 6Then you will see Enoch, Noah, Shem, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob raised from the dead, standing on the right side, rejoicing. 7Then we too will be raised from the dead, each in his own tribe. [And we will worship the King of heaven, who will appear on earth in the humble form of a human being. All those on earth who have believed in him will rejoice with him.] 8Then all will be resurrected, some to glory, some to dishonor. First of all, the Lord will judge Israel for their ungodliness against him, because they did not believe in God who had appeared in the flesh as their Savior. 9Then he will judge the nations as well, because they did not believe in him who appeared on earth. 10Through the chosen Gentiles he will reprove Israel, just as Esau did through the Midianites, who allowed them to become his brothers through their fornication and idolatry. Therefore he turned away from God. So then, my children, be among those who fear the Lord. 11But you, if you walk in holiness before the Lord, you will return to dwell with me in hope, and all Israel will gather before the Lord.<br />
        11No longer will I be called a ravening wolf for your robbery, but a worker for the Lord, distributing food to those who do good. 2In the last days there will arise from my descendants the one whom the Lord loves, who hears his voice on earth and carries out the good pleasure of his will. [He enlightens all nations with new knowledge, walking through Israel for their salvation as a light of knowledge and, like a wolf, stealing (people) from among them and handing them over to the assembly of the Gentiles. 3Until the end of time they will be in the meetings and among the leaders of the Gentiles as a melody in the mouths of all. 4Their work and their word will be written in holy books.] And he will be God's Chosen One forever. 5My father Jacob taught me about him: "He will supply the deficiencies of your tribe."<br />
        12When Benjamin had finished these words, he said to them:<br />
        “I command you, my sons, to take my bones out of Egypt and bury me in Hebron, near my fathers.” 2 Benjamin died at the age of 125, a peaceful old age, and they laid him in a coffin. 3 In the ninety-first year after the children of Israel entered Egypt, they and their brothers secretly took the bones of their fathers during the war with Canaan and buried them in Hebron at the feet of their ancestors. 4 Then they returned from the land of Canaan and lived in Egypt until the day they left that land.</p>
